 *
 * `@nocobase:registry` is written whenever the templates were fetched from somewhere other than the public npm,
 * because nothing else in a generated project records where NocoBase packages come from. This command passes its
 * registry to the one install it runs itself and that knowledge then evaporates: the next `pnpm add @nocobase/…` the
 * user runs — a database driver for another dialect, a plugin, an upgrade — resolves against the public npm and
 * fails with a 404 that says nothing about a registry. Scoped rather than global, so everything else still comes
 * from the public npm. It is omitted for the public registry so that an application generated after the packages are
 * published there does not carry a pin to a mirror it never needed.
 *
 * `strict-peer-dependencies=false` matches what this repository sets for itself. The templates carry the same line
 * in their own `.npmrc`, but npm strips that file from every tarball it builds, so it never reaches a generated
 * project and has to be written here instead.
