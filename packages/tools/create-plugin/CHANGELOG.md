# @nocobase/create-plugin

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- 1527426: Declare identity-sensitive runtime packages as peer dependencies of every plugin.

  A plugin used to list `@nocobase/app-server`, `@nocobase/db`, `@nocobase/service-provider`, `@nocobase/i18n`, `@nocobase/queue`, `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk`, and the plugins it builds on among its `dependencies`. Each of these carries state that only works while exactly one copy of the module exists in the process: `ServiceContainer` keys its bindings by the token object itself, React contexts match only the provider created from the same module, and `@nocobase/queue` registers job classes into a global `Locator`. A `dependencies` range lets a package manager install a second copy to satisfy it, which splits that state.

  The monorepo could never show the problem, because `workspace:` links every consumer to one directory. It appears once a plugin is installed from a registry into an application, and it appears at runtime rather than at install time: a service that is registered reports `Service "..." is not registered`, or a context reads `undefined` under a mounted provider.

  Each of these packages is now a peer dependency paired with a devDependency. The peer is the published contract that makes the installing application provide the single copy; the devDependency pins this repository's copy for development and tests, which the deliberately wide peer range does not. Applications built from the templates are unaffected — they already install every one of these packages directly, which is what satisfies the new peer ranges.

  `pnpm plugin:create` generates the same shape, and `pnpm peers:check` enforces it in CI.

### Patch Changes

- ab7b341: Add `defineDevRoutes()`, for pages that exist only while developing an application.

  It takes the same shape as `defineSettingsRoutes()` — pages, one level of groups, `navigation` and `access` — and mounts under `/dev` instead of `/settings`. The two are separate path spaces, so the same relative path may appear in both and resolve to `/settings/orders` and `/dev/orders`.

  What makes it different is that nothing it declares reaches a production bundle. The guard lives inside `defineDevRoutes()` rather than at each call site, so a plugin author calls it unconditionally the way they call `defineSettingsRoutes()` and cannot forget it. A production build replaces `import.meta.env.PROD` with `true`, which makes the argument unreachable and lets the bundler drop the page components behind it, along with any module only those pages import. The templates guard their `/dev` route and the dev entry in the header the same way, so a production build carries no dev route, no dev layout chunk, and no dev entry point.

  This draws its boundary at the build output, not at runtime permissions. A page that has to exist in production but be restricted by role is still a Settings Route with `access`, enforced by the server.

  Both templates' headers offer a dev entry beside the settings gear, visible only during development. A surface withdraws its own entry: the settings centre shows the dev entry but not the gear, the dev tools show the gear but not the dev entry, and the application shell shows both.

  Both templates gain a `client/layouts/` directory. The settings centre's chrome — the navigation rail, group disclosures, the mobile page select, and the per-page access filtering — is now one `SurfaceLayout` that the settings centre and the dev tools each render with their own copy, rather than a second copy of the same layout. The Hub template's settings navigation picks up the translation the default template already had.

  `client:inspect` reports the resolved dev routes and accepts `--type dev-routes`.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- fb1a752: Replace the ambiguous plugin scaffold capabilities `server.providers`, `client.providers`, and `client.bootstrap` with `server.service-providers`, `client.service-providers`, and `client.react-providers`.

  Generate static Client and Server contribution declarations, Client ServiceProvider lifecycle structure, and explicitly named React Provider structure for the selected capabilities.

- ac3f033: Export every server plugin from its package's `./server` entry point, and update application composition, plugin discovery, and generated plugins to use the unified entry point.

### Patch Changes

- 78cf0a2: Return a single versioned JSON envelope for both successful and failed Create
  Plugin and Plugin Skills synchronization commands. Plugin Skills
  synchronization now includes consistent success and failure statuses. JSON
  failures keep a non-zero exit code and expose stable error codes, readable
  messages, and actionable suggestions without appending non-JSON usage output.
- 78cf0a2: Add a complete App-facing Plugin Skill example with a reusable Notice component, an authenticated Server API, target-App integration tests, and capability-aware Skill scaffolding. Clarify System Info ownership, authorization, and behavioral verification guidance.
- 78cf0a2: Align Route examples, scaffolding guidance, and Agent-facing Client and Server Route documentation with the latest ownership and testing practices.
- 78cf0a2: Generate runtime-aware TypeScript, ESLint, Node engine, and development dependency configuration for Client-only, Server-only, and full-stack plugins, including stable package-scoped Queue Job identities.

  Keep plugins aligned with the Agent development contract by giving Queue, System Information, and Workflow Routes path-scoped authentication, documenting the Queue API path and Database declaration source accurately, and storing example tests under each plugin's root test directory.

## 0.0.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- Add explicit `client.locales` and `server.locales` capabilities, and stop generating locale resources implicitly for unrelated Client capabilities.
- b049266: Scaffold a plugin with locale files and a declared `locales` entry, so a new plugin starts out translatable rather than needing i18n retrofitted.
- 7cdffbd: Replace separate API and root route arrays with one ordered `routes` contribution array. Route factories now receive the Application, create and return their own Hono router, and are mounted automatically at `/api` or the application root according to their definition.

  Standardize plugin server modules around `providers/index.ts` and `routes/index.ts` collection entries, `services/` domain implementations, and a stable `tokens.ts` public contract.

  Generated plugins now declare conventional database and queue contribution directories by default. Missing optional directories are ignored until executable migrations, seeds, or jobs are added.

  Generated plugins now include an App-facing starter Agent Skill under the package's `skills/` directory. Plugin registration and skill synchronization copy these package-owned Skills into registered applications' `.agents/skills/` directories.

  Unify Client page contributions behind one `routes` loader. Plugins now use `defineAppRoutes()` and `defineSettingsRoutes()` to add child Routes to the application's two built-in Client Routes, mirroring how Server plugins use `defineRootRoutes()` and `defineApiRoutes()` with the built-in Hono routers.

- 12dfb68: Add the template-based `@nocobase/create-plugin` scaffold with complete client and server examples, including shadcn configuration for plugin-owned runtime UI and an application-owned Registry component recipe with build, materialize, and publishing metadata. Reuse the `nb3 app plugin` commands from the monorepo root, and register exported server plugin definitions in the application's explicit `server/plugins.ts` composition root.

  - @nocobase/dev-config@0.0.1-beta.1

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Add a template-based generator for NocoBase 3 application plugins.
- Document that the registration command automatically connects the generated `./server` export to the target application's explicit server composition root.
- Replace the complete default scaffold with explicit, composable plugin
  capabilities and a shared generation plan. Add structured JSON dry runs and
  require callers to select capabilities or explicitly request an empty
  package foundation.
