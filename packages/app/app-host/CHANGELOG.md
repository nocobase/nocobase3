# @nocobase/app-host

## 0.1.0-beta.4

### Minor Changes

- a864497: Add standalone and Hub-managed host modes, startup-only YAML or JSON host configuration, FS and S3 release deployment through NocoBase Drive, strict desired deployment reconciliation, file configuration path selection, host-owned structured logging, shared ws-backed App WebSocket handling, private authenticated child-process management over Node IPC, and bounded managed-host crash recovery. Managed deployments use checksum-addressed immutable revision directories, stop-first Runtime replacement with bounded graceful request draining, and a three-revision local cache for fast rollback. Rename the Host's in-process runtime implementation to `InProcessAppHandle`.

### Patch Changes

- a864497: Wait for prior revision cache cleanup before resolving or restoring the next deployment. Reject configuration publishing when the application is not registered or has no runtime configuration file instead of reporting success.
- a864497: Register the Application Hub in the Hub template and provide an application control plane. Release artifacts supply their version and an optional `config.example.yml` or `config.example.yaml` template, while applications choose Config file or External configuration and reserve Hub-managed configuration for a future database-backed implementation. Hub actions reconcile only the selected application, reuse an already installed matching artifact, report deployment phase timings, and support removing an application and its persisted resources. Separate Hub desired configuration files from Host-owned runtime configuration, rebuild recovery targets when Host becomes ready, and split the management page into business modules.

## 0.0.1-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- 7cdffbd: Add a runnable Koa fixture that adapts Koa's Node HTTP handler to the embedded app Fetch contract, and load workspace TypeScript exports correctly from the app-host development scripts.
- 7cdffbd: Add declarative application Runtime Definitions, shared application Scope, path, and disposal contracts, reusable Node standalone Scope and environment loading utilities, and focused Runtime Config section resolution. Resolve plugins before config factories and pass the complete resolved Runtime into application assembly, making Runtime plugins the single source for both configuration contributions and provider or route registration. Use the shared Runtime assembly across app-host and the default application template so embedded and standalone modes no longer maintain separate structural copies. Remove the template-local Scope and config-loading infrastructure, require standalone entrypoints to pass their resolved application root explicitly, and remove the legacy `/v2/api` proxy contract in favor of each application's local `/api` router.

## 0.0.1-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- 0465323: Expose application configuration paths to server plugins and add helpers for mounting redirect responses below an application's base path. Application hosts now rewrite root-relative redirects returned by embedded applications so installation and other redirects remain inside the mounted application.
