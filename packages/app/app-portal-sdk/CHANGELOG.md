# @nocobase/app-portal-sdk

## 1.0.0-beta.2

### Major Changes

- 174eab5: Consolidate the browser packages into `@nocobase/app-client`.

  `@nocobase/app-sdk` is gone; its API client now lives in `@nocobase/app-client` and is imported from there. `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk` is deprecated and keeps only what still has consumers: `NocoBaseClient` and the runtime configuration it reads, which exist to reach a v2 NocoBase server, and the route surface containers under `/routing`. Its ACL, auth, data, extension, i18n, and system-settings modules are removed, as is the route tree that `/routing` used to export alongside the surfaces.

  `@nocobase/app-client` gains `resolveAppBase()`, which reports the path the application is mounted at.

  Four plugins built their API client at import time instead of resolving it from the application's service container, so they could not see `api.baseURL` from the application configuration. They now resolve it, which means an application that configures a base URL gets one client rather than two that disagree.

  The injected browser global `NOCOBASE_PORTAL_BASE` is renamed to `APP_BASE_PATH`. Its value has always been the `APP_BASE_PATH` environment variable, and the old name grouped it with the settings that address a v2 NocoBase server. Those keep their names. A client and the server that serves it must be upgraded together.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-data-provider` is removed. It forwarded the Portal data provider, and applications built on the current client runtime do not use it.

  The Hub template is rebuilt from the default template and now runs the same client and server stack as every other v3 application. Its `/api/apps` endpoint and its v2 API proxy are gone, so a hub's `.env` no longer configures them.

  The Portal SDK's template compatibility check is removed with the rest: it had been disabled behind a constant, and its install script cost every generated project a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds` entry it did not need. `createPortalViteConfig` no longer takes the plugin that injected it.

### Patch Changes

- b049266: Mark the Portal i18n runtime deprecated in favour of `@nocobase/app-i18n`. It keeps its own i18next instance, so the two must not be mixed inside one application.
