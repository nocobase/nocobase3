# @nocobase/app-skills

## 0.1.0-beta.13

### Minor Changes

- 4e58fe3: Add `nocobase app config check` and `nocobase app config set`, run in an application as `pnpm config:check` and `pnpm config:set`, so a configuration is written by `config:init`, changed by `config:set` and verified by `config:check`.

  `config:check` loads the configuration through the application itself — its files, its environment and its code defaults — without starting it. A file that fails to parse, or a database driver that is not installed, fails here for the same reason it would fail a start. It then reports what loading alone does not show: a secret missing or still the placeholder, a `session.secret` that is regenerated at every start and so ends every session with the process, a top-level section nothing reads with the name that was probably meant, and a `${NAME}` written where it is not expanded and would be used as literal text. Databases other than SQLite are connected to, one connection each taken from the pool and handed back, without running SQL or migrating anything; `--connect` includes SQLite and `--no-connect` stays offline. Each finding carries the key and, where there is one, a command that fixes it, and the command exits non-zero on any error, or on any warning with `--strict`.

  `config:set` sets `key=value` assignments in the file the application reads, keeping its comments, and writes it once. A key under a section the application does not know is refused with the nearest known one, so a typo fails instead of being written where nothing reads it. With `--from-env` each value names an environment variable to read, so a secret stays out of the command line. After writing it loads the configuration again and reports any key an environment variable overrides.

  `config:init` now returns its `nextCommands` and, for a database other than SQLite, the `requiredSettings` still at a placeholder. On a terminal it asks for them, reading the password without echo, and tries the connection before writing. Run on an application that is already configured it leaves the file alone and reports `unchanged`, failing only when `--dialect` asks for a different database than the one configured.

  A built `dist/package.json` carries `config:check` and `config:set` scripts, and its `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `verifyDepsBeforeRun: false`, so running one of a deployment's own scripts never makes pnpm install first. `create-app` includes `pnpm config:check` in the `nextCommands` it returns.

  `AppConfig` gains `layers()`, which returns the code defaults and the values the application's own sources supply as separate read-only copies — the distinction a check needs to tell a known section from a misspelled one.

- 4e58fe3: Add `nocobase app config init`, which writes the configuration file an application starts from, and run it in an application with `pnpm config:init`.

  It generates `config.yml` from the application's `config.example.yml` so the example's comments reach the file people edit, fills in `auth.secret` and `session.secret`, and points `database.connections.main` at the selected dialect while leaving every other connection alone. The dialect defaults to the installed driver when there is exactly one, is asked for on a terminal when there are several, and must be given with `--dialect` in a script.

  The command installs nothing. Which dialects an application can run on is decided by the driver it depends on, so a missing one is reported with the `pnpm add` that supplies it — pinned to the range the installed `@nocobase/app-server` declares for that driver, because the newest release is not necessarily one the runtime was built against — rather than installed behind the user's back — in a deployment, where adding a driver to a built `dist` would be undone by the next build, it reports that the application has to be built again instead. Everything is validated before anything is written, so a run that reports a problem leaves the directory untouched and can simply be repeated once the driver is there.

  The three application templates now declare `@nocobase/db-sqlite`, the driver their own `server/config/database.ts` defaults to, so a new application can be configured and started without installing one first.

  `@nocobase/app-server` exports `OFFICIAL_DIALECTS` and `OfficialDialect` from `@nocobase/app-server/database`, so tooling that has to name the dialects reads the same list the runtime loads drivers from.

  The application development and deployment Skills describe the new step: how an application is configured, that the driver decides which dialects it can run on, and that a deployment writes its configuration with `pnpm config:init` inside `dist/`, from the `config.example.yml` the archive carries. The database Skill shipped with `@nocobase/db` now points at `pnpm config:init` rather than at a creation flag that no longer exists.

### Patch Changes

- 571e54e: Document where a Hub publishing key comes from in the application development Skill. `HUB_API_KEY` was named as a required variable without saying that it is created on Hub's API Keys page, bound to selected applications, and scoped to `upload-release`, `deploy`, or both, so agents and users had to find the entry point and permissions elsewhere.
- 1124eeb: Revert the Settings theme page and the converted theme presets.

  Theme selection returns to the header's Appearance popover, which again offers both the color mode and the theme list, and Settings → Theme is removed. The 30 presets converted from tweakcn are removed, the Compact and Spacious presets return in place of the single `default` density, and the `appearance` locale block goes back to `title`, `mode`, `preset`, `light`, `dark` and `system`. The theme references in `@nocobase/app-skills` describe the popover again, while keeping the guidance that surface and outline tokens name a layer rather than a shade.

## 0.1.0-beta.12

### Minor Changes

- 2ae6b2b: Ship the `nocobase-deployment` Skill with `@nocobase/app-skills`, so `nocobase skills sync` delivers it to every generated application instead of leaving it in the source repository where an application's agent never sees it. The Skill now reads the application's own README rather than repository paths, says that `pnpm build` already installs production dependencies into `dist/` and that `pnpm install --prod` there is a repair rather than a deployment step, and names both ways to enable a workflow whose deployed hash changed: **Enable new version** in workflow management, or the enable route called with the new hash. Each template's `AGENTS.md` points at the Skill next to the upgrade Skill, and the README's deployment section explains the same `pnpm install --prod` relationship.

### Patch Changes

- d5bafd4: Include the shadcn/ui React Hook Form guide in the application development Skill and require consulting it when implementing frontend form validation.
- 8f1ead4: Add `nocobase app db doctor`, which compares stored Collection metadata with the schema behind it and deletes the records whose table is gone.

  The physical schema and the Collection metadata are two records of what exists, and they can disagree: a table dropped outside a migration leaves its metadata record behind, and from then on resolving that Collection fails — including inside the migration that would recreate it, which is how the state becomes self-sustaining. Until now nothing reported it and nothing fixed it, so the only way out was deleting rows from `__nocobase_collection_metadata` by hand, which the documentation forbids for good reason.

  `ConnectionCollections.diagnose()` walks every metadata record, reports the ones whose physical table is missing as `COLLECTION_TABLE_MISSING`, and for the rest reports whatever resolving them reports. Only a missing table is marked `orphaned`, because deleting the record is then a complete fix; every other issue means the table is there and something in it no longer matches, which a migration has to reconcile.

  `db doctor` prints what disagrees per connection and exits non-zero while anything remains. `--fix` deletes the orphaned records and leaves the rest alone, `--connection` and `--all` select connections as they do elsewhere, and `--json` carries the result. The three templates gain a `db:doctor` script.

  `runAppCollectionsDoctor` is exported for hosts that run it themselves, and the connection selection the artifact generator already had is now shared rather than duplicated.

  The migrations reference also records why `onChecksumMismatch` defaults to `warn` and when to set `error` for a connection. The default was an implicit choice in the code, leaving a reader no way to judge whether to flip it: a checksum hashes the migration's file contents, so formatting the directory changes it and `error` would then stop the application from starting; startup runs migrations, so refusing to run turns drift into an outage on an upgrade where the compiled representation hashes differently. Nothing about the behaviour changes.

- ffafc2a: Replace notification configuration with named single-Provider Channels and send complete messages through a Channel-keyed map. Validate all messages before enqueueing, deliver native recipients independently, and retain retries bound to the original Channel and Provider. Simplify the test form and remove Provider instance names from delivery records with a new migration.
- a1a8690: Expire a task lock whose holder was killed, and add `nocobase app db unlock` to inspect and release one.

  A run that is hard-killed — SIGKILL, a stopped container, a lost machine — runs no cleanup, so its lock row survived it and every later run waited out the acquire timeout and then failed, until somebody deleted the row by hand. A holder now refreshes a `heartbeat_at` column every five seconds while it works, and a lock that has not been refreshed for thirty seconds is taken over by the next run, which then continues normally. The takeover is reported through `onStaleLock` and logged by the application, because it means a previous run did not shut down cleanly. A working run is never taken over: several missed beats are tolerated, so a slow database does not hand the lock to a second run.

  The lock table gains `heartbeat_at`, added in place when the table predates it. It cannot be a migration: the lock is what every migration runs inside.

  `db unlock` reports who holds each lock — the owner, when it was taken, and its last heartbeat — and releases the ones that have stopped beating. A lock that is still beating is reported rather than released; `--force` releases it anyway, which lets a second run start beside the first. It covers the migration and the seed lock together, takes `--connection` / `--all` / `--json` like the other database commands, and needs no migration or seed directory, since startup and plugins take the same locks. The three templates gain a `db:unlock` script.

  `Migrator` and `Seeder` gain `lock()`, which reads the lock without creating its table, and `unlock(options)`. `AppDatabaseTaskOperation` gains `'unlock'`, and a task result carries `lock`, `released` and `lockReason`. The exhausted-wait message now names the last heartbeat and points at `db unlock` rather than at deleting a row by hand.

- 183751a: Synchronize application Skills after installation and consolidate client and server development guidance into each template's root AGENTS.md.

## 0.1.0-beta.11

### Minor Changes

- 5380642: Hand the database API back to the `nocobase-db` Skill and keep the application side here.

  The application development Skill carried its own account of the database API because the package published none. Now that `@nocobase/db` ships a Skill of its own, two copies would drift, and the copy here had already fallen behind: it documented QueryAdapter but not Repository, and its seed example wrote rows through `query` when a seed context now defaults to `repository`.

  So the three database references keep what the application owns — where `database/<connection>/` sits, what `pnpm db:apply`, `db:reset` and `db:repair` do, how additional connections configure their tasks, legacy directory migration, checksum drift, compiled manifests, the task `config` reader, dialect packages and their fields, driver installation and native binaries — and point to the package's Skill for the API the files are written against. `migrations.md` loses the migration and seed examples, the field builders, the alter operations and the naming rules; `database-and-data.md` keeps resolving the manager, where data access belongs in an application, and generated IDs.

### Patch Changes

- 56613b2: Point the application development Skill at `client/pages/reference/` before it designs UI of its own. Every current template ships worked screens and one page per shadcn/ui primitive there, unrouted and kept to be read, so the Skill names which page to open for a list, a record editor or a settings screen, and says to copy the structure without importing or routing the source. An application generated before that directory existed does not have it, and the guidance says so rather than sending the reader after a missing path.
- d696700: Stop the `bubblegum` theme from turning settings pages into competing hues, and fix the token misuse it exposed.

  The preset was carried over from tweakcn verbatim, and upstream spends the generic surface and outline roles on decoration: `--card` was a cream 101 degrees of hue away from the pink `--background`, `--border` was `--primary` itself at chroma 0.18 against a median of 0.02 across the other thirty presets, and `--muted` was a cyan. One demonstration card and a few dividers carry that; a settings page stacking several panels over dozens of hairlines does not, and pages showed pink, cream, cyan and teal at once. Six light values are retuned — `--card`, `--border`, `--muted`, `--input`, `--sidebar-border` and `--sidebar-primary` — keeping those roles in the background's hue family and leaving the preset's colour in `--primary`, `--secondary` and `--accent`. The dark values, the radius, and every other preset are unchanged, and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` records the deviation.

  The same pages also used tokens for something other than their role, which no neutral preset makes visible. Authorization's two page shells and four Hub pages painted the whole page with `bg-muted/20`, which is the page surface and belongs to `bg-background`; under a preset whose `--muted` is a real colour that was a film over the entire viewport. The AI employee page's read-only fields hand-rolled `bg-muted/40` instead of using the shared `Input` and `Textarea` with `disabled`, three information callouts were fixed `bg-blue-50`, and the MCP transport labels were fixed `bg-blue-100`/`bg-green-100`/`bg-amber-100`; the transports now take their three tones from the theme's chart series, which is what a preset defines to be told apart.

  Three fixed colours on settings pages are corrected while they are in hand. The AI employee page's missing-knowledge-base warning and the schedule detail page's target-issue icon named a light-mode ink with no dark counterpart, so both were close to unreadable on a dark card; they now carry one. The routes example reported a load failure in a fixed red, which is what `--destructive` is for.

  The theme authoring reference and the token reference now state the rule, so a preset converted tomorrow is checked against it.

- fa01814: Report migration and seed checksum drift as a warning instead of failing, and add `nocobase app db repair` to realign the recorded history.

  An executed migration or seed whose source has since changed no longer stops the run. `latest()`, `rollback()` and `run()` return the drift in a new `warnings` field, the CLI prints it, `--json` carries it, and startup logs it through the application logger. Set `onChecksumMismatch: 'error'` on a connection's `migrations` or `seeds` configuration, or at the top level, to keep refusing to run. A history record whose migration is missing from the sources entirely still fails regardless of the policy.

  `pnpm db:repair` rewrites recorded checksums to match the current sources, covering both migrations and seeds in one command. It previews before writing, prompts for confirmation unless `--force` is passed, supports `--dry-run` for inspection in CI, and conditions every write on the checksum it read, so a history changed in between fails rather than being overwritten. It never deletes a history record, so a repair cannot make an executed task run again.

- fa01814: Add `db apply` and `db reset`, and retire `migrate --fresh`.

  `nocobase app db apply` (`pnpm db:apply`) runs migrations and seeds as one plan, in the order startup runs them: each connection is migrated, then seeded. Only pending tasks run, so repeating it is safe. `nocobase app db reset` (`pnpm db:reset`) drops every managed schema object first and reruns both from empty; it asks for confirmation and requires `--force` in CI or a non-interactive terminal.

  `migrate --fresh` is removed and now exits with a pointer to `db reset`. It rebuilt the schema without reseeding, so it left the seed history cleared and no seed executed — the default connection recovered on the next startup, and a connection with `autoRun: false` did not.

  The `migrate` and `seed` commands are removed along with their template scripts; `db apply` replaces both. Running one half on its own is not a separate command, because both halves apply only what is pending: on an already-migrated database `db apply` applies seeds alone, and the one case it does not cover — migrating ahead of a deployment without seeding — can be served by a flag later without breaking anything.

  `runAppDatabaseTasks` accepts several task kinds in one plan through its `kind` option, which is what makes a reset correct across both kinds: one plan means a connection's schema is rebuilt by its migrations task before its seeds run.

- 7bde7bd: Add `nocobase app db rollback` and `nocobase app db redo`, so a migration corrected before its branch is merged can be re-run without resetting the database.

  Editing an executed migration changes nothing on its own: it is recorded as executed, so `db apply` skips it and the database keeps the schema the old source produced. Until now the only way forward was `db reset`, which drops every managed table and every row with it, or editing the history table by hand — which the documentation forbids, and which splits the two records of what exists: dropping a table without its metadata record leaves the Collection unresolvable.

  `db rollback` runs `down()` for the latest migration batch, newest first, and deletes its history records. The batch is the unit the history records, so a batch that mixed application and plugin migrations rolls back as one, and the confirmation lists every migration with the package it belongs to before anything runs. It fails having run nothing when a migration in the batch is irreversible or has no `down()`. `db redo` is that followed by `db apply`. Both are destructive in the same way and confirm the same way: CI and non-interactive terminals require `--force`, `--connection` and `--all` select connections as they do elsewhere, and `--json` carries the result. Seeds are not re-run, so rows a seed inserted into a table the batch recreates are not restored.

  `Migrator.rollback()` accepts `{ dryRun: true }`, which is what the confirmation is built from: it takes the lock, resolves the batch, rejects an irreversible one, and reports what a run would undo without running any `down`. `MigrationRollbackResult` gains `records` — the batch's history records in rollback order, carrying each migration's package — and `dryRun`. `AppDatabaseTaskOperation` gains `'rollback'`, which applies to migrations alone: a plan including seeds is refused, because seeds have no inverse.

  The three templates gain `db:rollback` and `db:redo` scripts. The migrations reference now documents re-running a corrected migration, states what `db:repair` is and is not for — it records that the schema already matches, so using it on a change the database never received leaves the schema wrong and nothing recording that — and lists each internal table with the command that maintains it.

- 56613b2: Index `client/pages/reference/` so an agent can find the right page instead of listing the directory. A new `README.md` there maps the screen being built to the example page and the blocks inside it, and the interaction needed to the component page that demonstrates the primitive, with the Base UI API detail each one is easy to get wrong; every example page now opens with a module comment naming the patterns it holds, the component or block holding each one, and the parts that are demonstration filler.

  The application development Skill points at that README and turns "read a worked page" into ordered steps: pick the page from the table, read its header, open only the blocks the task needs, check the primitives exist, copy the skeleton without the mock data or frame, and move the strings into the application locales. Its components reference gains a section on Base UI composition — `render` in place of `asChild`, `data-icon` on icons beside text, grouped menu items, nullable `onValueChange` values — and a table of the compositions the template ships in `client/components/`, including that `toast.add` needs a `Toaster` the shell does not mount.

- d4783c2: Guide agents to preserve extension components and page source during customization, disable frontend feature availability reversibly, and enforce disabled operations on the server.
- d4783c2: Guide application agents to scope formatting, lint, type checking, tests, builds, and runtime verification to affected files, projects, or packages, expanding checks only when the impact requires it.
- d696700: Give every settings surface the token that matches what it is, so panels stop disagreeing with one another.

  The permission set editor is where this shows: its two tabs sit in one panel, and the permission configuration tab painted itself `bg-background` while the assignment tab inherited the panel's `bg-card`, so switching tabs changed the page colour under the same heading. The same mistake is spread across the settings pages, and none of it is visible under a preset whose page and card are near-identical.

  Each token names a layer rather than a shade, and every site now uses the one that describes it. A panel resting on the page is `bg-card`, which is what the AI tools and skills pages already used while the LLM service, MCP service, conversation, API key, user and notification log panels named the page surface instead — two lists in one plugin, one framed and one flat. A dialog or drawer is `bg-popover`, which is what the shared `Sheet`, `Dialog` and `Popover` primitives use and what six hand-rolled drawers and dialogs did not. An opaque sticky header, footer or table head names the surface it scrolls within rather than the page behind it. A form control names no surface at all and inherits the one it sits on, the way the shared `Input` and `Textarea` do with `bg-transparent`; twenty hand-rolled inputs, selects and text areas were pinned to the page colour and showed through as a differently coloured box inside every card.

  The styling reference now states which token describes which layer, and why picking one because it happens to look right is what puts a page-coloured block inside a panel.

- d696700: Make the compact density the only density and call it Default.

  Settings → Theme no longer offers Compact and Spacious as two cards with one palette. The former Compact preset is now `default`, the fallback every fresh browser starts on, and the former Spacious preset is gone. Every other preset takes the same `--spacing` of `0.2rem` and the same tighter line heights from `sm` to `4xl`, so switching palettes never changes the density; each keeps its own corner radius. A browser that saved `compact` falls back to `default` and sees the same theme; one that saved `default` now sees it at the compact density.

  The `appearance.themes.compact` label is removed and `appearance.themes.default` reads "Default" / "默认". The theme references record `default` as the fallback and the new typography values.

- d696700: Ship 30 more theme presets, converted from the tweakcn collection.

  An application now starts with 32 presets to choose from in Settings → Theme: the two it had, and 30 palettes covering minimal, warm, pastel, brutalist, terminal and night looks. A converted file states the same tokens as the shipped presets — the fonts, text sizes, spacing and shadows Default defines — and takes only the colours and corner radius from upstream, so each one reads as Default with a different palette and none needs a font resource. The upstream opacity, shadow, letter-spacing and spacing values stay out, which is what keeps CJK rendering and density consistent across the grid.

  The palettes are the upstream ones and have not been re-audited for contrast against this application's components. The theme reference now records the conversion rules, and `client/theme/themes/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` in each template names the source revision, the Apache-2.0 licence and the values the conversion drops.

- d696700: Move theme selection out of the header popover and onto a Settings page.

  The header entry is now a single button that switches between light and dark and says what it does through its tooltip and accessible label, instead of a popover offering both the color mode and the theme list. Choosing a theme is a longer-lived decision and gets a page of its own: Settings → Theme renders every registered preset as a preview card in an auto-filling grid with the selection marked, and filters the grid through a search field, so an application with dozens of themes stays workable. Selection still lives in the browser, under the same storage keys and `config.yml` defaults.

  The page declares `authz` on its route, so it is visible to administrators by default and grantable to another role through the permissions interface like any other page. `system` stays a valid configured default: the header button moves to the opposite explicit mode on its first click.

  The `appearance` locale block now carries `toggle` and `theme.{title,description,search,empty}` in place of `title`, `mode`, `preset`, `light`, `dark` and `system`; the theme labels under `appearance.themes` are unchanged. The themes and header-action references describe the new page and the in-place toggle.

## 0.0.2-beta.10

### Patch Changes

- 43592e9: Support users.initialAdmin credentials for fresh installations, preserving legacy defaults when omitted and assigning root permission to the configured administrator without resetting existing accounts.
- 43592e9: Expose a read-only config.get() reader and service container to migration and seed callbacks. Inject application configuration snapshots for startup and CLI database tasks and document configuration and rollback semantics.

  Restrict application database task service access to the ID generator and reuse the templates’ application factory for CLI migrations and seeds. CLI tasks share the application database manager and dispose application and scope resources without booting providers or triggering autoRun.

  Simplify createAppCommands to one options object with lazy rootDir-based runtime and application discovery and optional factory overrides.

## 0.0.2-beta.9

### Patch Changes

- 5e3c802: Extract shared application development and build tooling into app-tools and runtime CLI commands into app-cli. Keep template entry points and application composition local, preserve supported commands and development restart behavior, and document customization and upgrade boundaries.

  Remove the application client and server inspection commands, their development-only CLI registration, and related guidance.

- 9f52fc6: Correct route authorization guidance to use the existing authz field instead of the removed access field.
- 5e3c802: Isolate client inspection and file-watching test caches from running Vite development servers to prevent missing lazy dependency chunks. Document cache ownership for auxiliary Vite instances.
- 8124b03: Mirror every synchronized skill into `.claude/skills/` as a relative symbolic link, so Claude Code discovers the skills an application's NocoBase packages ship. Claude Code reads only `~/.claude/skills/` and `<project>/.claude/skills/`, so a synchronized `.agents/skills/` was invisible to it while globally installed NocoBase 2 skills stayed available. Removing a package or a skill drops its link, application-owned entries are left alone, and a real directory occupying a `nocobase-` name is reported rather than overwritten. Ignore the generated mirror in the template and generated `.gitignore` files alongside `.agents/`.
- 5e3c802: Restart development processes when .env or .env.local changes, reloading client and server environment configuration while preserving shell overrides and strict startup behavior.
- 5e3c802: Replace template development forwarding files with a single dev entry and a direct proxy helper import. Expose the dev lifecycle through the tools launcher and keep development implementation modules and tests inside app-tools.

  Consolidate standalone server dependency operations into one template entry and keep build utility implementations and exports private to app-tools.

  Organize template scripts by purpose and remove redundant test:all, refine, template pack:check, and plugin:skills:sync shortcuts. Keep the application CLI entry and legacy CLI compatibility command unchanged.

## 0.0.2-beta.8

### Patch Changes

- e819ad3: Make the application tests shipped with templates runnable after scaffolding with a custom project name and installed npm packages, and document how to keep these tests portable.
- 24f142b: Remove centered width constraints from PageContainer examples and related application development guidance.

## 0.0.2-beta.7

### Patch Changes

- 71d159c: Preinstall editable File Registry components and their OOXML client dependency in the Default template so applications can reuse authenticated DOCX, XLSX and PPTX previews. Clarify component reuse, dependency ownership and separate Skill/UI upgrade steps in the file and application development guidance.

  Keep the shared file preview dialog wide on desktop and within the viewport on small screens, and normalize Date metadata in its refresh key for strict application linting.

- 836014a: Synchronize the shared layout containers and AppLayout organization with Examples while preserving template branding and Hub navigation ordering. Update application guidance for the shared layout components and layout-owned permission checks.

## 0.0.2-beta.6

### Patch Changes

- f93f147: Remove the default SQLite driver dependency from application templates. Application creation supplies the database driver selected by --dialect, defaulting to SQLite.

## 0.0.2-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- 64b3fdb: Integrate source-qualified database authorization and native relation policies with AI data services. Preserve explicit route group extensions, translated resource search, Hub ownership checks, API key cleanup, and protected permission-set assignments across user deletion. Update shared application guidance for the split authorization plugins.
- 64b3fdb: Document business authorization development, scope-rule configuration, inherited subjects and server enforcement in the published Skills, with application-level guidance to select the authorization workflow. Make installed Skills self-contained with client integration, code-versus-seed decisions, complete API contracts and the current sales collaboration and delivery examples.
- 64b3fdb: Focus authorization Skills on designing and implementing application business permissions. Consolidate repeated API guidance, add a policy-bound transactional workflow example, require model development and accompanying business permission configuration according to each requested change, and correct seed imports and optional-rule examples.
- 64b3fdb: Add business-action authorization middleware for existing Repository route definitions. Intersect request constraints with endpoint policies, reject incomplete multi-scope shortcuts, and demonstrate project queries and editing in the authorization example. The example's project edit now uses `salesProjects:updateOne` with Repository input/output and 404 for out-of-scope targets.

  Document when to use generated CRUD versus custom business handlers in the authorization development Skill. Remove the separate authorization example Skill and its package publication entry.

  Remove the collection-aggregated `authz.db.repositories` adapter and its public types. Use `authz.db.authorizeRepository` with explicit business-action mappings for generated Repository routes.

- fe564d9: Support database selection with --dialect and non-interactive structured output with --json. Generate local database connection settings, install compatible drivers, and guide agents through configuration before startup.
- fe564d9: Default generated applications to verifyDepsBeforeRun: false so running development, build, or startup scripts does not implicitly install dependencies. Document explicit installation after dependency changes and preserve template-provided settings.
- 64b3fdb: Remove Refine from client authorization checks. Use `AuthorizationClient.can({ resource, action })` instead of the removed two-argument signature, and import `useCan` from `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/client`. Migrate page guards, navigation, and notification visibility while preserving session isolation and realtime permission invalidation.

  Remove the Refine access-control configuration and legacy global authorization client accessors. Resolve the application-owned client through `useAuthorizationClient()` or `authorizationClientToken`. Settings actions now revoke stale access immediately; route checks no longer bypass the authorization page or translate Refine CRUD action names.

  Unify route authorization under `authz: 'skip' | { resource: { type, id }, action }`. Normalize default rules during registration and share them across page guards, navigation, permission discovery, and inspection. Remove the legacy `access` field and string resource adapter.

  Limit settings action checks to the actions each page uses, keep the permission-set action helper internal, and avoid rebuilding navigation twice when selecting a route.

- fe564d9: Add opt-in strict startup verification that propagates job import failures and exits development and production processes on startup failure.
- fe564d9: Transform the queue loader in both Vitest presets so dynamically discovered TypeScript jobs load through the test runtime instead of Node's strip-only loader. Document the shared preset requirement for application job-discovery tests.

## 0.0.2-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- e9da3c2: Resolve installed official database drivers asynchronously from application configuration before provider registration or standalone database tasks. Configure only the needed dialects and install their optional peer packages in application dependencies. Preserve explicit driver registrations and synchronous core manager APIs; direct core consumers continue to register drivers explicitly. Standard development and test loaders require no synchronous ESM compatibility configuration.

## 0.0.2-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- a255f91: Use the Compact theme by default across application templates while preserving configured defaults and saved browser preferences. Label the other theme Spacious instead of Default to avoid confusing its name with the default selection. Update theme development guidance.
- e55b17d: Document top-right header interactions: localized tooltips for navigation entries and built-in hover menus or configuration panels with default dismissal behavior.
- e13ed84: Organize Hub storage by ownership, add explicit managed revision and log directories, retain legacy layouts, and provide an offline migration preview and copy workflow. Keep standalone Hub data outside build output and place template build archives under storage/exports with matching publishing defaults.
- e13ed84: Make development logs concise and application-scoped while retaining structured file diagnostics. Route configuration and authentication diagnostics through application logging, reduce routine startup and request noise, distinguish optional AI Skill directories from missing configured paths, and align development console settings across templates. Document that deployed applications need rebuilding to adopt the current logging protocol.
- 64733b6: Clarify that useRouteOverlay must run in a descendant of the intended overlay, with complete usage examples and guidance on avoiding the parent context in nested overlays.
- e13ed84: Persist per-deployment phase and failure logs and expose application runtime logs in Hub with scoped access, incremental reading, retention, and independent file and console outputs.

  Unify runtime logging configuration and source routing, merge default outputs into app files, connect workflow diagnostics with execution identities, and preserve legacy configuration and historical log readability.

  Enforce hosted capture policy, declare the Host server runtime peer, merge paged source logs chronologically with bounded opaque cursors, and preserve correlation and error details when truncating oversized records. Handle expired scans explicitly in the Hub viewer and downloads.

  Route HTTP request logs to separate request files by default in all application templates.

- e13ed84: Unify application directory fields and path helpers in AppPaths, shared by configuration factories, runtime and Application. Replace ConfigPaths and runtime.configPaths with AppPaths and runtime.paths, and construct applications through createAppFromRuntime so Host logging policy and the runtime application reference are wired consistently.

  Standalone applications declare their deployment root separately from their code root. Configuration and default persistent storage use that deployment root in both source and compiled execution. Explicit storage paths take precedence over HUB_STORAGE_DIR, and embedded applications retain Host-provided volumes.

  Standardize Hub storage and expanded releases on the hub, host and apps layout, remove legacy layout detection and offline storage migration commands, and replace appDeploymentsDir with appRevisionsDir. Expanded releases use appRevisionsDir/<appId>/<sha256>; standalone discovery records the selected revision. Consumers must update removed path and storage APIs and configure existing data locations explicitly before adopting this release. Rebuild application artifacts with the updated runtime and templates.

## 0.0.2-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- d4ca00e: Expose useApiClient as a no-argument Hook for resolving the current application's API client and document it as the convenient React entry point. Existing useService(apiClientToken) calls remain supported.
- d4ca00e: Clarify React API client access through useApiClient and retain explicit client resolution for non-React code in application and inbox Skills.
- f13bd0c: Clarify page authoring references, child routes for page Tabs and overlays, and page container ownership in the application development Skill.
- 365a9fe: Document semantic translation key naming, grouping, interpolation, and rename guidance with examples for application and plugin development.
- 60fa139: Preserve Hub publishing guidance in the shared application skill and scope it to Default applications that provide upload and deploy commands.
- d4ca00e: Document frontend API client usage, request and Repository response contracts, uploads, cancellation and error handling in a dedicated application Skill reference.
- d4ca00e: Use useApiClient() for React API client access across application pages, plugins and shared examples, preserving application-scoped client resolution.
- 60fa139: Wait for the final deployment result by default in app deploy and app upload --deploy. Support --no-wait for asynchronous acceptance, preserve explicit --wait compatibility, and keep upload-only commands independent of deployment polling.

## 0.0.2-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- 6e15911: Register all application plugins as production dependencies so they reach deployments, migrate legacy development declarations, and preserve declared version ranges when registering existing plugins.

  Document plugin dependency placement and migration in the shared application development Skill.

## 0.0.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- d86f6aa: Synchronize agent skills from direct NocoBase package dependencies with the new skills:sync command while preserving plugin:skills:sync compatibility, and share application development and upgrade skills through @nocobase/app-skills across all application templates.

  Add package:remove to uninstall a NocoBase dependency and clean up its synchronized skills and ownership records, reusing plugin unregistration for plugin packages. Document the removal workflow in application templates and the shared development and upgrade skills.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Add the initial NocoBase application development and upgrade Skills.
