## 0.0.2-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- a255f91: Use the Compact theme by default across application templates while preserving configured defaults and saved browser preferences. Label the other theme Spacious instead of Default to avoid confusing its name with the default selection. Update theme development guidance.
- e55b17d: Document top-right header interactions: localized tooltips for navigation entries and built-in hover menus or configuration panels with default dismissal behavior.
- e13ed84: Organize Hub storage by ownership, add explicit managed revision and log directories, retain legacy layouts, and provide an offline migration preview and copy workflow. Keep standalone Hub data outside build output and place template build archives under storage/exports with matching publishing defaults.
- e13ed84: Make development logs concise and application-scoped while retaining structured file diagnostics. Route configuration and authentication diagnostics through application logging, reduce routine startup and request noise, distinguish optional AI Skill directories from missing configured paths, and align development console settings across templates. Document that deployed applications need rebuilding to adopt the current logging protocol.
- 64733b6: Clarify that useRouteOverlay must run in a descendant of the intended overlay, with complete usage examples and guidance on avoiding the parent context in nested overlays.
- e13ed84: Persist per-deployment phase and failure logs and expose application runtime logs in Hub with scoped access, incremental reading, retention, and independent file and console outputs.

  Unify runtime logging configuration and source routing, merge default outputs into app files, connect workflow diagnostics with execution identities, and preserve legacy configuration and historical log readability.

  Enforce hosted capture policy, declare the Host server runtime peer, merge paged source logs chronologically with bounded opaque cursors, and preserve correlation and error details when truncating oversized records. Handle expired scans explicitly in the Hub viewer and downloads.

  Route HTTP request logs to separate request files by default in all application templates.

- e13ed84: Unify application directory fields and path helpers in AppPaths, shared by configuration factories, runtime and Application. Replace ConfigPaths and runtime.configPaths with AppPaths and runtime.paths, and construct applications through createAppFromRuntime so Host logging policy and the runtime application reference are wired consistently.

  Standalone applications declare their deployment root separately from their code root. Configuration and default persistent storage use that deployment root in both source and compiled execution. Explicit storage paths take precedence over HUB_STORAGE_DIR, and embedded applications retain Host-provided volumes.

  Standardize Hub storage and expanded releases on the hub, host and apps layout, remove legacy layout detection and offline storage migration commands, and replace appDeploymentsDir with appRevisionsDir. Expanded releases use appRevisionsDir/<appId>/<sha256>; standalone discovery records the selected revision. Consumers must update removed path and storage APIs and configure existing data locations explicitly before adopting this release. Rebuild application artifacts with the updated runtime and templates.

## 0.0.2-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- d4ca00e: Expose useApiClient as a no-argument Hook for resolving the current application's API client and document it as the convenient React entry point. Existing useService(apiClientToken) calls remain supported.
- d4ca00e: Clarify React API client access through useApiClient and retain explicit client resolution for non-React code in application and inbox Skills.
- f13bd0c: Clarify page authoring references, child routes for page Tabs and overlays, and page container ownership in the application development Skill.
- 365a9fe: Document semantic translation key naming, grouping, interpolation, and rename guidance with examples for application and plugin development.
- 60fa139: Preserve Hub publishing guidance in the shared application skill and scope it to Default applications that provide upload and deploy commands.
- d4ca00e: Document frontend API client usage, request and Repository response contracts, uploads, cancellation and error handling in a dedicated application Skill reference.
- d4ca00e: Use useApiClient() for React API client access across application pages, plugins and shared examples, preserving application-scoped client resolution.
- 60fa139: Wait for the final deployment result by default in app deploy and app upload --deploy. Support --no-wait for asynchronous acceptance, preserve explicit --wait compatibility, and keep upload-only commands independent of deployment polling.

## 0.0.2-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- 6e15911: Register all application plugins as production dependencies so they reach deployments, migrate legacy development declarations, and preserve declared version ranges when registering existing plugins.

  Document plugin dependency placement and migration in the shared application development Skill.

## 0.0.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- d86f6aa: Synchronize agent skills from direct NocoBase package dependencies with the new skills:sync command while preserving plugin:skills:sync compatibility, and share application development and upgrade skills through @nocobase/app-skills across all application templates.

  Add package:remove to uninstall a NocoBase dependency and clean up its synchronized skills and ownership records, reusing plugin unregistration for plugin packages. Document the removal workflow in application templates and the shared development and upgrade skills.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Add the initial NocoBase application development and upgrade Skills.
