## 0.0.2-beta.7

### Patch Changes

- 71d159c: Preinstall editable File Registry components and their OOXML client dependency in the Default template so applications can reuse authenticated DOCX, XLSX and PPTX previews. Clarify component reuse, dependency ownership and separate Skill/UI upgrade steps in the file and application development guidance.

  Keep the shared file preview dialog wide on desktop and within the viewport on small screens, and normalize Date metadata in its refresh key for strict application linting.

- 836014a: Synchronize the shared layout containers and AppLayout organization with Examples while preserving template branding and Hub navigation ordering. Update application guidance for the shared layout components and layout-owned permission checks.

## 0.0.2-beta.6

### Patch Changes

- f93f147: Remove the default SQLite driver dependency from application templates. Application creation supplies the database driver selected by --dialect, defaulting to SQLite.

## 0.0.2-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- 64b3fdb: Integrate source-qualified database authorization and native relation policies with AI data services. Preserve explicit route group extensions, translated resource search, Hub ownership checks, API key cleanup, and protected permission-set assignments across user deletion. Update shared application guidance for the split authorization plugins.
- 64b3fdb: Document business authorization development, scope-rule configuration, inherited subjects and server enforcement in the published Skills, with application-level guidance to select the authorization workflow. Make installed Skills self-contained with client integration, code-versus-seed decisions, complete API contracts and the current sales collaboration and delivery examples.
- 64b3fdb: Focus authorization Skills on designing and implementing application business permissions. Consolidate repeated API guidance, add a policy-bound transactional workflow example, require model development and accompanying business permission configuration according to each requested change, and correct seed imports and optional-rule examples.
- 64b3fdb: Add business-action authorization middleware for existing Repository route definitions. Intersect request constraints with endpoint policies, reject incomplete multi-scope shortcuts, and demonstrate project queries and editing in the authorization example. The example's project edit now uses `salesProjects:updateOne` with Repository input/output and 404 for out-of-scope targets.

  Document when to use generated CRUD versus custom business handlers in the authorization development Skill. Remove the separate authorization example Skill and its package publication entry.

  Remove the collection-aggregated `authz.db.repositories` adapter and its public types. Use `authz.db.authorizeRepository` with explicit business-action mappings for generated Repository routes.

- fe564d9: Support database selection with --dialect and non-interactive structured output with --json. Generate local database connection settings, install compatible drivers, and guide agents through configuration before startup.
- fe564d9: Default generated applications to verifyDepsBeforeRun: false so running development, build, or startup scripts does not implicitly install dependencies. Document explicit installation after dependency changes and preserve template-provided settings.
- 64b3fdb: Remove Refine from client authorization checks. Use `AuthorizationClient.can({ resource, action })` instead of the removed two-argument signature, and import `useCan` from `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/client`. Migrate page guards, navigation, and notification visibility while preserving session isolation and realtime permission invalidation.

  Remove the Refine access-control configuration and legacy global authorization client accessors. Resolve the application-owned client through `useAuthorizationClient()` or `authorizationClientToken`. Settings actions now revoke stale access immediately; route checks no longer bypass the authorization page or translate Refine CRUD action names.

  Unify route authorization under `authz: 'skip' | { resource: { type, id }, action }`. Normalize default rules during registration and share them across page guards, navigation, permission discovery, and inspection. Remove the legacy `access` field and string resource adapter.

  Limit settings action checks to the actions each page uses, keep the permission-set action helper internal, and avoid rebuilding navigation twice when selecting a route.

- fe564d9: Add opt-in strict startup verification that propagates job import failures and exits development and production processes on startup failure.
- fe564d9: Transform the queue loader in both Vitest presets so dynamically discovered TypeScript jobs load through the test runtime instead of Node's strip-only loader. Document the shared preset requirement for application job-discovery tests.

## 0.0.2-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- e9da3c2: Resolve installed official database drivers asynchronously from application configuration before provider registration or standalone database tasks. Configure only the needed dialects and install their optional peer packages in application dependencies. Preserve explicit driver registrations and synchronous core manager APIs; direct core consumers continue to register drivers explicitly. Standard development and test loaders require no synchronous ESM compatibility configuration.

## 0.0.2-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- a255f91: Use the Compact theme by default across application templates while preserving configured defaults and saved browser preferences. Label the other theme Spacious instead of Default to avoid confusing its name with the default selection. Update theme development guidance.
- e55b17d: Document top-right header interactions: localized tooltips for navigation entries and built-in hover menus or configuration panels with default dismissal behavior.
- e13ed84: Organize Hub storage by ownership, add explicit managed revision and log directories, retain legacy layouts, and provide an offline migration preview and copy workflow. Keep standalone Hub data outside build output and place template build archives under storage/exports with matching publishing defaults.
- e13ed84: Make development logs concise and application-scoped while retaining structured file diagnostics. Route configuration and authentication diagnostics through application logging, reduce routine startup and request noise, distinguish optional AI Skill directories from missing configured paths, and align development console settings across templates. Document that deployed applications need rebuilding to adopt the current logging protocol.
- 64733b6: Clarify that useRouteOverlay must run in a descendant of the intended overlay, with complete usage examples and guidance on avoiding the parent context in nested overlays.
- e13ed84: Persist per-deployment phase and failure logs and expose application runtime logs in Hub with scoped access, incremental reading, retention, and independent file and console outputs.

  Unify runtime logging configuration and source routing, merge default outputs into app files, connect workflow diagnostics with execution identities, and preserve legacy configuration and historical log readability.

  Enforce hosted capture policy, declare the Host server runtime peer, merge paged source logs chronologically with bounded opaque cursors, and preserve correlation and error details when truncating oversized records. Handle expired scans explicitly in the Hub viewer and downloads.

  Route HTTP request logs to separate request files by default in all application templates.

- e13ed84: Unify application directory fields and path helpers in AppPaths, shared by configuration factories, runtime and Application. Replace ConfigPaths and runtime.configPaths with AppPaths and runtime.paths, and construct applications through createAppFromRuntime so Host logging policy and the runtime application reference are wired consistently.

  Standalone applications declare their deployment root separately from their code root. Configuration and default persistent storage use that deployment root in both source and compiled execution. Explicit storage paths take precedence over HUB_STORAGE_DIR, and embedded applications retain Host-provided volumes.

  Standardize Hub storage and expanded releases on the hub, host and apps layout, remove legacy layout detection and offline storage migration commands, and replace appDeploymentsDir with appRevisionsDir. Expanded releases use appRevisionsDir/<appId>/<sha256>; standalone discovery records the selected revision. Consumers must update removed path and storage APIs and configure existing data locations explicitly before adopting this release. Rebuild application artifacts with the updated runtime and templates.

## 0.0.2-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- d4ca00e: Expose useApiClient as a no-argument Hook for resolving the current application's API client and document it as the convenient React entry point. Existing useService(apiClientToken) calls remain supported.
- d4ca00e: Clarify React API client access through useApiClient and retain explicit client resolution for non-React code in application and inbox Skills.
- f13bd0c: Clarify page authoring references, child routes for page Tabs and overlays, and page container ownership in the application development Skill.
- 365a9fe: Document semantic translation key naming, grouping, interpolation, and rename guidance with examples for application and plugin development.
- 60fa139: Preserve Hub publishing guidance in the shared application skill and scope it to Default applications that provide upload and deploy commands.
- d4ca00e: Document frontend API client usage, request and Repository response contracts, uploads, cancellation and error handling in a dedicated application Skill reference.
- d4ca00e: Use useApiClient() for React API client access across application pages, plugins and shared examples, preserving application-scoped client resolution.
- 60fa139: Wait for the final deployment result by default in app deploy and app upload --deploy. Support --no-wait for asynchronous acceptance, preserve explicit --wait compatibility, and keep upload-only commands independent of deployment polling.

## 0.0.2-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- 6e15911: Register all application plugins as production dependencies so they reach deployments, migrate legacy development declarations, and preserve declared version ranges when registering existing plugins.

  Document plugin dependency placement and migration in the shared application development Skill.

## 0.0.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- d86f6aa: Synchronize agent skills from direct NocoBase package dependencies with the new skills:sync command while preserving plugin:skills:sync compatibility, and share application development and upgrade skills through @nocobase/app-skills across all application templates.

  Add package:remove to uninstall a NocoBase dependency and clean up its synchronized skills and ownership records, reusing plugin unregistration for plugin packages. Document the removal workflow in application templates and the shared development and upgrade skills.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Add the initial NocoBase application development and upgrade Skills.
