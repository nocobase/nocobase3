# @nocobase/app-server

## 1.0.0-beta.4

### Major Changes

- 174eab5: Consolidate the browser packages into `@nocobase/app-client`.

  `@nocobase/app-sdk` is gone; its API client now lives in `@nocobase/app-client` and is imported from there. `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk` is deprecated and keeps only what still has consumers: `NocoBaseClient` and the runtime configuration it reads, which exist to reach a v2 NocoBase server, and the route surface containers under `/routing`. Its ACL, auth, data, extension, i18n, and system-settings modules are removed, as is the route tree that `/routing` used to export alongside the surfaces.

  `@nocobase/app-client` gains `resolveAppBase()`, which reports the path the application is mounted at.

  Four plugins built their API client at import time instead of resolving it from the application's service container, so they could not see `api.baseURL` from the application configuration. They now resolve it, which means an application that configures a base URL gets one client rather than two that disagree.

  The injected browser global `NOCOBASE_PORTAL_BASE` is renamed to `APP_BASE_PATH`. Its value has always been the `APP_BASE_PATH` environment variable, and the old name grouped it with the settings that address a v2 NocoBase server. Those keep their names. A client and the server that serves it must be upgraded together.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-data-provider` is removed. It forwarded the Portal data provider, and applications built on the current client runtime do not use it.

  The Hub template is rebuilt from the default template and now runs the same client and server stack as every other v3 application. Its `/api/apps` endpoint and its v2 API proxy are gone, so a hub's `.env` no longer configures them.

  The Portal SDK's template compatibility check is removed with the rest: it had been disabled behind a constant, and its install script cost every generated project a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds` entry it did not need. `createPortalViteConfig` no longer takes the plugin that injected it.

- 174eab5: Rename four packages, dropping the qualifiers they only carried to avoid names the v2 line had taken.

  | Before                     | After                  |
  | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | `@nocobase/app-database`   | `@nocobase/db`         |
  | `@nocobase/app-i18n`       | `@nocobase/i18n`       |
  | `@nocobase/app-server-kit` | `@nocobase/app-server` |
  | `@nocobase/id-generator`   | `@nocobase/snowflake`  |

  There is no compatibility shim: the old names receive no further releases, and a dependency on one has to be repointed by hand. Each package keeps its version history, which is why the changelogs say which name the earlier releases went out under.

  `@nocobase/app-server` reclaims a name the v2 line abandoned at `0.11.1-alpha.5`, so it starts at `1.0.0-beta.0` rather than continuing its own `0.1.0-beta` line — `0.1.0` sorts below `0.11.1`, and npm would have rejected the publish. The other three take names that were never published.

  `@nocobase/snowflake` also now matches what it implements; its only source file was already called `snowflake.ts`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [174eab5]
  - @nocobase/db@1.0.0-beta.2
  - @nocobase/i18n@1.0.0-beta.1
  - @nocobase/snowflake@1.0.0-beta.3
  - @nocobase/queue@0.1.0-beta.3

The versions below were published as `@nocobase/app-server-kit`, the name this package carried until it was renamed to
`@nocobase/app-server`. They are kept because they describe this same codebase; the `@nocobase/app-server-kit` releases they
name are not, and never will be, versions of `@nocobase/app-server`.

## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- ac3f033: Replace aggregated application configuration objects and config factories with typed module-owned configuration definitions. Applications now compose defaults, file providers, environment layers, validation, explicit reloads, and subscriptions through `AppConfig`, while providers read their configuration through `app.config.get(definition)`.
- fb1a752: Unify Client and Server application composition around the explicit `serviceProviders` contribution and rename Client React tree contributions to `reactProviders`.

  Replace Client bootstrap modules with application-owned ServiceProvider lifecycle hooks, make the default Client start through `ClientApplication` and render through the Browser host, and update built-in plugins and runtime inspection to the new static contribution protocol.

- 78cf0a2: Add declaration-level Server plugin inspection with real Route contribution order, and make the Routes example own a path-scoped authentication boundary.
- fb1a752: Transport public Client configuration through a versioned, safely escaped JSON data block in SPA HTML and read it automatically during Client runtime resolution.

  Apply the same HTML transformation to production static responses and development Vite proxy responses, and document the public `config.yml` Client section in the default template.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- 7cdffbd: Add reusable application-scope cancellation and disposer lifecycle primitives, and use them for the default template standalone scope.
- 7cdffbd: Add reusable application-scope path, environment, and routing resolvers, while keeping default-template configuration mappings application-owned.
- 7cdffbd: Move public base-path mounting and mounted origin proxy adapters into `@nocobase/app-server` so standalone applications can reuse the host-neutral runtime boundary.
- 7cdffbd: Replace separate API and root route arrays with one ordered `routes` contribution array. Route factories now receive the Application, create and return their own Hono router, and are mounted automatically at `/api` or the application root according to their definition.

  Standardize plugin server modules around `providers/index.ts` and `routes/index.ts` collection entries, `services/` domain implementations, and a stable `tokens.ts` public contract.

  Generated plugins now declare conventional database and queue contribution directories by default. Missing optional directories are ignored until executable migrations, seeds, or jobs are added.

  Generated plugins now include an App-facing starter Agent Skill under the package's `skills/` directory. Plugin registration and skill synchronization copy these package-owned Skills into registered applications' `.agents/skills/` directories.

  Unify Client page contributions behind one `routes` loader. Plugins now use `defineAppRoutes()` and `defineSettingsRoutes()` to add child Routes to the application's two built-in Client Routes, mirroring how Server plugins use `defineRootRoutes()` and `defineApiRoutes()` with the built-in Hono routers.

- 7cdffbd: Add reusable Node HTTP, WebSocket, and standalone server definition adapters with graceful shutdown handling, Vite overrides, mounted application lifecycle ownership, standard listen configuration, and startup cleanup. Reduce the default template standalone entry to binding its root directory, Runtime Definition, and shared server factory. Derive the application package name from its root package metadata and keep standard standalone routing defaults in the Node runtime instead of repeating them in each Runtime Definition.
- 7cdffbd: Add explicit `server/plugin.ts` definitions for Providers, API routes, root routes, database sources, and queue jobs. Register routes in a dedicated Application phase after Provider boot, add reusable HTTP and runtime composition helpers to their owning packages, and remove the default template's duplicate runtime layer and legacy plugin discovery contract.
- 7cdffbd: Move server plugin manifest resolution, Provider loading, and database or queue contribution discovery into the public `@nocobase/app-server/plugins` entry. The default application template now consumes the shared implementation.
- 7cdffbd: Add declarative application Runtime Definitions, shared application Scope, path, and disposal contracts, reusable Node standalone Scope and environment loading utilities, and focused Runtime Config section resolution. Resolve plugins before config factories and pass the complete resolved Runtime into application assembly, making Runtime plugins the single source for both configuration contributions and provider or route registration. Use the shared Runtime assembly across app-host and the default application template so embedded and standalone modes no longer maintain separate structural copies. Remove the template-local Scope and config-loading infrastructure, require standalone entrypoints to pass their resolved application root explicitly, and remove the legacy `/v2/api` proxy contract in favor of each application's local `/api` router.

### Patch Changes

- Report Server plugin locale declarations during static inspection without executing their loaders.
- Add a consistent Server inspection summary with deduplicated recovery suggestions.
- b049266: Add language switching on top of `@nocobase/i18n`. Applications and plugins declare their locales the same way on both sides, the browser loads only the language it is showing, and the chosen one is kept in storage and mirrored to the server session.
- ce4eab8: Add a focused ServiceProvider plugin example with a tokenized heartbeat
  service, lifecycle management, and an HTTP status route. Pass the Application
  directly to providers and standardize service access through `app.container`.

## 0.0.1-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- 0465323: Expose application configuration paths to server plugins and add helpers for mounting redirect responses below an application's base path. Application hosts now rewrite root-relative redirects returned by embedded applications so installation and other redirects remain inside the mounted application.
