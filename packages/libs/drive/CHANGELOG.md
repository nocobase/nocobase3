# @nocobase/drive

## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- 9536bf5: Drop `links` from `AppDriveConfig` and stop creating symlinks in `prepareDriveStorage`, which now takes no options and returns only `directories`.

  The change itself landed with the Hub deployment work, but only the packages on the other side of it were released: `@nocobase/app-server` shipped as `1.0.0-beta.7` without `links` in its drive configuration, while `@nocobase/drive` stayed at the previously published `0.1.0-beta.2`, whose `prepareDriveStorage` still reads `config.links`. An application installing both from the registry gets that pair — `app-server` declares `^0.1.0-beta.2`, so nothing rejects it — and crashes on boot with `TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object` from `Object.entries(config.links)`. Releasing this package is what makes the two halves agree again.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- ac3f033: Replace aggregated application configuration objects and config factories with typed module-owned configuration definitions. Applications now compose defaults, file providers, environment layers, validation, explicit reloads, and subscriptions through `AppConfig`, while providers read their configuration through `app.config.get(definition)`.

## 0.0.1-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- ce4eab8: Add a focused ServiceProvider plugin example with a tokenized heartbeat
  service, lifecycle management, and an HTTP status route. Pass the Application
  directly to providers and standardize service access through `app.container`.
