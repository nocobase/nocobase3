# @nocobase/repository-input

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- 90a4903: Add portable Repository AST and mutation input builders shared by browser and server clients. Support synchronous builder callbacks and complete JSON options helpers for all nine remote Repository actions, including nested selections, relation mutations, and numeric updates. Preserve relation create client keys through an explicit JSON envelope and reject unserializable builder inputs before sending requests.

### Patch Changes

- 90a4903: Add server-owned writePolicy for single and bulk creates/updates, root upserts and
  mutation preflight. Internal Repository calls default to true. Explicit policies
  restrict scalar fields, each relation operation, nested create/update/upsert branches
  and through payloads before any writes. Add buildWritePolicy, buildUpsertWritePolicy
  and synchronous callback input, frozen snapshots and structured policy errors.

  Replace defineRepositoryApiRoutes action arrays with configuration objects and move
  maxLimit to actions.findMany. API create/update actions default to writePolicy false
  and require explicit allowlists; true and client-supplied policies are rejected.
  Return HTTP 403 for forbidden writes and migrate the Repository example's routes,
  fixtures and integration guidance to field and relationship policies.

## 0.0.1
