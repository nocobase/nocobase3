### Patch Changes

- c960d07: Replace the Repository API's per-action `writePolicy` with a Repository Policy
  declared once per exposure.

  **Breaking.** `defineRepositoryApiRoutes()` no longer accepts `writePolicy` on
  an action, and every exposure must declare a `policy`. An action configuration
  now says only that an endpoint exists; what it may do is the exposure's Policy,
  which governs reading, creating, updating and deleting together. Declaring one
  is required rather than optional because `writePolicy` defaulted to refusing
  writes while an absent Policy restricts nothing — making it optional would have
  turned every existing declaration from "refuse every write" into "allow
  everything" without a word of warning.

  Declare `policy` as a function of a principal, together with a
  `principal(context)` resolver, to scope rows to the caller. The resolver belongs
  to the application, since this router installs no authentication; one that
  returns nothing refuses the request with 403 `PRINCIPAL_REQUIRED` rather than
  binding a Policy built from a principal that is not there. A fixed Policy is
  still normalized when the routes are defined, so a malformed one fails where it
  is written; a Policy function cannot be, and its `INVALID_POLICY` now reaches
  the host error handler as a server error instead of being reported to the caller
  as a 400.

  `@nocobase/db` gains `buildRepositoryPolicy`, a builder whose unmentioned nodes
  are denied, so the four-node requirement costs nothing to satisfy while the
  default stays refusal. Two related fixes travel with it: `create`, `update` and
  `delete` nodes that are `false` now refuse a write before its payload is read,
  so an empty body is reported as forbidden rather than as invalid input; and a
  `create` node whose relations grant `update`, `upsert`, `disconnect`, `set` or
  `delete` is refused during normalization, since a root create performs none of
  them.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-file` exposures declare a Policy too, and it reaches
  uploads: the upload path binds a Policy derived from the exposure's, inheriting
  `create.scope` and `create.defaults` and substituting the file columns for the
  field allowlist. A file uploaded under a scoped Policy therefore lands inside
  the scope the same exposure reads from. The public content route under
  `accessPath` is unchanged and deliberately outside it.

  The method-level `writePolicy` option on `db.repository()` calls is unaffected
  and remains available for narrowing a single call.

### Minor Changes

- 90a4903: Support asynchronous iteration of remote Repository `findMany` queries over framed NDJSON while preserving array consumption through `await`.
- 90a4903: Add portable Repository AST and mutation input builders shared by browser and server clients. Support synchronous builder callbacks and complete JSON options helpers for all nine remote Repository actions, including nested selections, relation mutations, and numeric updates. Preserve relation create client keys through an explicit JSON envelope and reject unserializable builder inputs before sending requests.
- 90a4903: Expose opt-in aggregate and groupBy Repository HTTP actions with JSON AST validation, grouped filters and sorting, and lossless BigInt result serialization. Add matching remote Repository methods and public types. Switch the aggregate example to the generic authenticated endpoints and display its actual Repository requests.
