# @nocobase/db-postgres

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- ceb356b: Add dialect driver registration support and the initial PostgreSQL dialect package.

### Patch Changes

- ceb356b: Move all concrete dialect connection resolution, schema inspectors, native
  driver loading, pool hooks, precise integer codecs, and capability profiles into
  the corresponding dialect packages. `@nocobase/db` now requires an explicitly
  registered dialect driver and no longer exports concrete dialect inspectors or
  native-driver fallbacks.
- ceb356b: Expose the dialect runtime strategy contract used by database connections and
  the Knex-backed query, repository, schema, and application composition
  adapters. Dialect packages now own connection defaults, ownership identity, and
  local storage preparation, while the database configuration API accepts
  additional dialect identifiers without core changes.
- ceb356b: Add the destructive `pnpm migrate --fresh --force` workflow for managed
  connections. It clears dialect-owned schema objects, reruns visible migrations,
  requires confirmation in interactive terminals, and rejects external
  connections.
- 590861e: Decode JSON columns according to a result form the dialect declares instead of guessing from the value.

  A driver either parses a JSON column before returning the row or hands back the stored text, and the returned value carries no evidence of which. Decoding by attempting to parse any string therefore corrupted a JSON string whose content is itself JSON: writing `'{"a":1}'` and reading it back produced the object `{ a: 1 }` on PostgreSQL, Kingbase, MySQL, and OceanBase, whose drivers parse JSON themselves. Each dialect now declares `jsonResults`, and a value that a text driver cannot parse is reported as `INVALID_STORED_VALUE` rather than returned as the raw string.

  Where the driver can be told to behave the other way, the declaration is derived from the resolved connection rather than fixed: mysql2 returns a json column as text under `jsonStrings`, which reaches it through `driverOptions`, and the Dameng driver decodes the column under `parseJson`. A fixed declaration would be wrong for exactly those connections, which is the failure this change exists to remove.

  Query and Repository also no longer disagree about a column holding the JSON literal `null`: Query fell back to the raw value whenever a decoder legitimately returned `null`, so the stored text leaked back to the caller.

  Altering a JSON column on Oracle no longer fails with `ORA-40664`. Knex compiles a JSON column to `varchar2(4000) check (col is json)`, and repeating that definition on a MODIFY asks Oracle for a second IS JSON check constraint on the same column. A dialect now learns whether a column is being created or redefined, and Oracle omits the constraint while altering; the MODIFY leaves the constraint the original definition created in place.

  A dialect that builds a JSON column as something other than Knex's `json()` also loses the JSON default handling that comes with it, and an object default would reach the column as `[object Object]` — on Oracle that is text its own IS JSON constraint then rejects. Such a dialect now asks for the default as encoded text, while MySQL keeps receiving the value because that is what makes it compile the expression form its engine requires. A JSON default consequently works on Dameng, where the column is a plain clob and the default was silently stored as something that could not be read back.

- ceb356b: Make dialect integration tests own their disposable Docker Compose environments
  with random host ports and automatic cleanup.
- ceb356b: Declare runtime imports in the published package dependencies.
- ceb356b: Declare the PostgreSQL query-stream dependency required by Knex at runtime.
