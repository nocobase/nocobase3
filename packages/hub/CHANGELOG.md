## 0.0.1-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- 7cdffbd: Add declarative application Runtime Definitions, shared application Scope, path, and disposal contracts, reusable Node standalone Scope and environment loading utilities, and focused Runtime Config section resolution. Resolve plugins before config factories and pass the complete resolved Runtime into application assembly, making Runtime plugins the single source for both configuration contributions and provider or route registration. Use the shared Runtime assembly across app-host and the default application template so embedded and standalone modes no longer maintain separate structural copies. Remove the template-local Scope and config-loading infrastructure, require standalone entrypoints to pass their resolved application root explicitly, and remove the legacy `/v2/api` proxy contract in favor of each application's local `/api` router.

## 0.0.1-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- 8fb9319: Declare the pnpm version this package is developed with, so working on it uses the same pnpm as the rest of the monorepo.

## 0.0.1-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- 0465323: Introduce the plugin-based authorization core and permission management UI. Replace the previous authorization API with composable core, database, permission-set, default-access, sharing-rule, restriction-rule, and page plugins; add route access metadata to the application client; publish and enable the authorization app plugin in the default template; and correct the Hub documentation to use the v3 Portal SDK package name.
- 0465323: Declare explicit publish files for the example plugins and Hub template, and add a safe Hub environment example for generated projects.

## 0.0.1-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- 89fc34a: Upgrade Agent Annotations to version 0.1.5 and prevent its runtime files from triggering repeated Vite page reloads.

## 0.0.1-beta.0
