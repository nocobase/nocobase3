# @nocobase/create-plugin

## 0.0.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- b049266: Scaffold a plugin with locale files and a declared `locales` entry, so a new plugin starts out translatable rather than needing i18n retrofitted.
- 7cdffbd: Replace separate API and root route arrays with one ordered `routes` contribution array. Route factories now receive the Application, create and return their own Hono router, and are mounted automatically at `/api` or the application root according to their definition.

  Standardize plugin server modules around `providers/index.ts` and `routes/index.ts` collection entries, `services/` domain implementations, and a stable `tokens.ts` public contract.

  Generated plugins now declare conventional database and queue contribution directories by default. Missing optional directories are ignored until executable migrations, seeds, or jobs are added.

  Generated plugins now include an App-facing starter Agent Skill under the package's `skills/` directory. Plugin registration and skill synchronization copy these package-owned Skills into registered applications' `.agents/skills/` directories.

  Unify Client page contributions behind one `routes` loader. Plugins now use `defineAppRoutes()` and `defineSettingsRoutes()` to add child Routes to the application's two built-in Client Routes, mirroring how Server plugins use `defineRootRoutes()` and `defineApiRoutes()` with the built-in Hono routers.

- 12dfb68: Add the template-based `@nocobase/create-plugin` scaffold with complete client and server examples, including shadcn configuration for plugin-owned runtime UI and an application-owned Registry component recipe with build, materialize, and publishing metadata. Reuse the `nb3 app plugin` commands from the monorepo root, and register exported server plugin definitions in the application's explicit `server/plugins.ts` composition root.
- Updated dependencies [b049266]
  - @nocobase/dev-config@0.0.1-beta.1

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Add a template-based generator for NocoBase 3 application plugins.
- Document that the registration command automatically connects the generated `./server/plugin` export to the target application's explicit server composition root.
