# @nocobase/app-plugin-authorization-example

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- 86c4d2c: Allow unfulfilled example orders to have a null delivery reference, fixing Oracle startup seeds and example data resets. Upgrade existing schemas with a new migration while retaining delivery-time validation. Rolling back requires filling any missing delivery references first.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- cbee7d8: Use consistent PageContainer and PageHeader layouts for the sales permission example pages and add a shield icon to their navigation group.

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- 64b3fdb: Separate authorization services from application integration: the library provides decisions, permission-set and access-rule services, store contracts and handlers; the application plugin owns database adapters, migrations, identities and management UI.

  Add configurable root and default permission sets, protected-set metadata, transaction-bound service APIs, and integration with user management and Hub roles. Add database authorization for explicitly registered collections through Repository policies, plus a runnable example plugin.

  Provide a permission-set workspace with routed editing and user assignments, nested resource groups, field and record-scope controls, and a permission inspector. Localize management UI and request-specific resource labels. Application routes may declare signed-in access without a page grant.

  Migration ownership changes inline the existing table definitions in the application plugin. This changes the checksums of previously executed migrations; upgrade compatibility must be resolved before deploying to an existing database.

- 64b3fdb: Add independent Policy-shaped relation permission declarations and immutable fluent builders, resolve target record scopes, and require explicit relation grants when narrowing repository API policies. Extend the sales authorization example with delivery-team associations, nested delivery checks, many-to-many collaborator notes, and an interactive relationship editor.

  Replace the business resource and collection/page declaration factories with callback-based authorization resources and reusable database permissions. Bind configuration keys at the action boundary, retain direct registration, and migrate the sales example without changing persisted grant or rule shapes.

  Move record access registration to the authorization core, add portable defineRecordAccess declarations, and consume repository-input FilterAst values only in the DB adapter. Migrate the sales example and policy selectors to generic resource references.

  Remove obsolete Business-prefixed public contracts and unused page/registry-bound builder entry points. Keep resource grant construction internal to the authorization package.

  Remove directional input/output objects from database grant fields. Use field lists or '*' per action, reject obsolete object-shaped grants, and update examples, documentation and tests. Request field directions remain supported.

### Patch Changes

- 64b3fdb: Separate business resource declarations from underlying handler registration through `resourceTypes`. Remove transitional registration aliases and legacy title decoding. Store rule record IDs directly in each action's JSON, preserving independent named scopes without auxiliary record tables. Initialize the sales example and Hub permission titles directly in their final form, without development-version upgrade scripts.
- 64b3fdb: Document business authorization development, scope-rule configuration, inherited subjects and server enforcement in the published Skills, with application-level guidance to select the authorization workflow. Make installed Skills self-contained with client integration, code-versus-seed decisions, complete API contracts and the current sales collaboration and delivery examples.
- 64b3fdb: Organize authorization example routes by business responsibility with explicit endpoint declarations and shared validation/error handling. Document which operations can suit generated CRUD and which require business handlers.
- 64b3fdb: Filter and paginate authorization example team queries in the database and use the caller transaction for active-team checks. Team pickers retain the existing management endpoint permissions.
- 64b3fdb: Add business-action authorization middleware for existing Repository route definitions. Intersect request constraints with endpoint policies, reject incomplete multi-scope shortcuts, and demonstrate project queries and editing in the authorization example. The example's project edit now uses `salesProjects:updateOne` with Repository input/output and 404 for out-of-scope targets.

  Document when to use generated CRUD versus custom business handlers in the authorization development Skill. Remove the separate authorization example Skill and its package publication entry.

  Remove the collection-aggregated `authz.db.repositories` adapter and its public types. Use `authz.db.authorizeRepository` with explicit business-action mappings for generated Repository routes.

- 64b3fdb: Add composed business operations with named data scopes and categorized business and administration groups. Permission and rule editors expose only this catalog; page, collection and custom resource handlers remain internal authorization targets.

  Enforce per-operation default access, sharing and restriction scopes while preserving field permissions. Return resolved underlying decisions and repository policies for inspection and execution.

  Use translation descriptors for permission titles, integrate permission-set assignments into user management, and demonstrate independent project, quote and order scopes with direct and team-based assignments.

- 64b3fdb: Add composable, typed authorization builders with plugin-owned page and database grants, immutable scopes, and record-access policy registration. Support portable build/reference/register APIs and pure permission-set and rule DSL builders. Convert the sales example and its per-table seed data to shared fluent declarations while preserving authorization behavior.

  Separate page entry permissions from business data operations. Expose registered pages independently in permission sets and the inspector, and restrict business composition to database grants.

- 64b3fdb: Remove Refine from client authorization checks. Use `AuthorizationClient.can({ resource, action })` instead of the removed two-argument signature, and import `useCan` from `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/client`. Migrate page guards, navigation, and notification visibility while preserving session isolation and realtime permission invalidation.

  Remove the Refine access-control configuration and legacy global authorization client accessors. Resolve the application-owned client through `useAuthorizationClient()` or `authorizationClientToken`. Settings actions now revoke stale access immediately; route checks no longer bypass the authorization page or translate Refine CRUD action names.

  Unify route authorization under `authz: 'skip' | { resource: { type, id }, action }`. Normalize default rules during registration and share them across page guards, navigation, permission discovery, and inspection. Remove the legacy `access` field and string resource adapter.

  Limit settings action checks to the actions each page uses, keep the permission-set action helper internal, and avoid rebuilding navigation twice when selecting a route.

- 64b3fdb: Move default user permission-set integration into the Users plugin and remove duplicated template providers. Add application-owned preset title metadata for client-side localization without overwriting custom names. Preserve Hub's custom role scope and share searchable assignment selection between user creation and editing.
- 64b3fdb: Reuse list-page permissions for repository detail routes and correct the authorization example's stored page grants to use route names.
- 64b3fdb: Align the sales authorization example with quote ownership, explicit team collaboration and independently retained project management duties. Add business-oriented exercises, keep delivery controls in sync after completion, and limit practice resets to seeded orders and their relationships.
- 64b3fdb: Make the sales authorization example repeatable with administrator-only business-record reset, independent cross-region team handover, accepted order-source quotes, job-based account names and staged exercises. Derive row actions from their read/write policies and distinguish invalid input, denied permissions and state conflicts.
- 64b3fdb: Unify grantable resource registration through getResource(type).items and separate recursive display groups. Move authorization settings to module-qualified items under the built-in settings resource, replace the database collections registration entry point, and preserve page navigation groups in the resource picker. Existing authorization settings grant records are not migrated.

  Replace the permission-set list and separate detail view with a collapsible, searchable sidebar and routed permission configuration and user-assignment tabs. Keep edits in the workspace with save/discard controls and protected-set restrictions. Present registered resources in an expandable tree with searchable field configuration in a local floating panel, and toggle simple permissions directly between full access and no grant.
