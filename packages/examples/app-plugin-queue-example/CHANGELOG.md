# @nocobase/app-plugin-queue-example

## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- ac3f033: Export every server plugin from its package's `./server` entry point, and update application composition, plugin discovery, and generated plugins to use the unified entry point.

### Patch Changes

- 78cf0a2: Generate runtime-aware TypeScript, ESLint, Node engine, and development dependency configuration for Client-only, Server-only, and full-stack plugins, including stable package-scoped Queue Job identities.

  Keep plugins aligned with the Agent development contract by giving Queue, System Information, and Workflow Routes path-scoped authentication, documenting the Queue API path and Database declaration source accurately, and storing example tests under each plugin's root test directory.

## 0.0.1-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- ce4eab8: Add a focused ServiceProvider plugin example with a tokenized heartbeat
  service, lifecycle management, and an HTTP status route. Pass the Application
  directly to providers and standardize service access through `app.container`.
- 7cdffbd: Replace separate API and root route arrays with one ordered `routes` contribution array. Route factories now receive the Application, create and return their own Hono router, and are mounted automatically at `/api` or the application root according to their definition.

  Standardize plugin server modules around `providers/index.ts` and `routes/index.ts` collection entries, `services/` domain implementations, and a stable `tokens.ts` public contract.

  Generated plugins now declare conventional database and queue contribution directories by default. Missing optional directories are ignored until executable migrations, seeds, or jobs are added.

  Generated plugins now include an App-facing starter Agent Skill under the package's `skills/` directory. Plugin registration and skill synchronization copy these package-owned Skills into registered applications' `.agents/skills/` directories.

  Unify Client page contributions behind one `routes` loader. Plugins now use `defineAppRoutes()` and `defineSettingsRoutes()` to add child Routes to the application's two built-in Client Routes, mirroring how Server plugins use `defineRootRoutes()` and `defineApiRoutes()` with the built-in Hono routers.

- 7cdffbd: Add explicit `server/plugin.ts` definitions for Providers, API routes, root routes, database sources, and queue jobs. Register routes in a dedicated Application phase after Provider boot, add reusable HTTP and runtime composition helpers to their owning packages, and remove the default template's duplicate runtime layer and legacy plugin discovery contract.
