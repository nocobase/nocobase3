# Repository API example

A working Repository API plugin demonstrating `defineRepositoryApiRoutes`, array and streamed `findMany`, relationship selections and mutations, optimistic locking, atomic updates, and aggregate queries.

## Open the example

This workspace registers the plugin in `@nocobase/app-template-default`.

```bash
pnpm --filter @nocobase/app-template-default migrate
pnpm --filter @nocobase/app-template-default seed
pnpm --filter @nocobase/app-template-default dev
```

Sign in and expand **CRM example** or **Orders example** in the sidebar. Each child menu opens its own page:

- **CRM example**: Customers (`/repository-example/crm`), Contacts (`/repository-example/crm/contacts`).
- **Orders example**: Orders (`/repository-example/orders`), Order items (`/repository-example/orders/items`), Products (`/repository-example/orders/products`).
- **Repository examples**: relationship writes (`/repository-example/relation-mutations`), `findMany` array/stream (`/repository-example/find-many`), atomic numeric updates (`/repository-example/atomic`), aggregate queries (`/repository-example/aggregate`).

View details opens the child route `<list-path>/details/:recordId`, for example `/repository-example/crm/details/demo-customer-1`. Detail URLs load records directly, support refresh, show related records, and provide a Back to list action. Relation headings use singular labels for belongsTo and plural labels for hasMany. Related records link to their detail pages; customer cards show name, company and email, and foreign-key fields display the related name. New and Edit open a right-side drawer with focus management and Escape/Cancel dismissal. Relation and status fields use shadcn Select, with full-width triggers and readable selected labels. Successful saves close the drawer and refresh the list or current detail; errors keep the drawer and entered values visible.

The active child expands its parent group. Each page has a stable URL, so refresh and browser history retain the selected entity.

Paths are relative to the application's mount point. For an application mounted at `/main`, the CRM URL is `/main/repository-example/crm`.

Create a customer in CRM and products in Orders → Products. When creating an order, add item rows directly in the drawer: select a product, enter quantity, and adjust the automatically populated price if needed. Rows can be removed before saving; subtotals and the order total update immediately. A single `createOne` request writes the order and `items.create` rows atomically. Order details show product names, SKUs, quantities, snapshot prices, subtotals and the total, with links to product and item details. The separate Order items page remains available to manage existing items. The seed adds 4 customers, 5 contacts, 6 products, 4 orders and 8 order items. It covers every customer/order status and multiple related records; the paid order demonstrates a discounted price snapshot. The tables are isolated from the application's real customers and orders.

The seed uses fixed `demo-*` IDs, `DEMO-*` SKUs and `DEMO-SO-*` order numbers. The seed runner records completion and skips subsequent runs, so edits and deletions remain intact. If the seed is deliberately replayed without its history, it only inserts missing IDs and preserves existing records. Unique SKU/order-number collisions with another ID fail the entire transaction without leaving partial example data.

## Schema and relationships

| Logical collection / API name      | Fields                                                      | Relationships                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `repositoryExampleCustomers`       | `id`, `name`, `company`, `email`, `status`                  | hasMany `contacts`, hasMany `orders`   |
| `repositoryExampleContacts`        | `id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `customerId`                | belongsTo `customer`                   |
| `repositoryExampleProducts`        | `id`, `name`, unique `sku`, `unitPriceCents`                | hasMany `items`                        |
| `repositoryExampleOrders`          | `id`, unique `number`, `status`, `customerId`, `version`    | belongsTo `customer`, hasMany `items`  |
| `repositoryExampleOrderItems`      | `id`, `orderId`, `productId`, `quantity`, `unitPriceCents`  | belongsTo `order`, belongsTo `product` |
| `repositoryExampleFindManyRecords` | `id`, unique `sequence`, `title`, `category`, `description` | —                                      |

The browser generates UUID IDs for new records; seeded examples use stable `demo-*` IDs. Monetary values use integer cents; each item stores its own unit price snapshot, so later product price changes do not rewrite existing orders. The displayed line total is quantity × unit price. Customer statuses are `lead`, `active`, `inactive`; order statuses are `draft`, `confirmed`, `paid`, `cancelled`.

The self-contained migration creates the tables, unique constraints, relationship metadata and foreign keys. The belongsTo side owns each physical foreign key and its supporting index; the inverse hasMany side uses `constraints(false)` to avoid duplicating them. Deleting a customer cascades its contacts; deleting an order cascades its items. Customers referenced by orders and products referenced by items cannot be deleted. Rollback drops the tables in reverse dependency order.

The relationship-write page uses six additional collections. Their logical names are deliberately prefixed so they do not collide with an application's own `users`, `projects`, `tasks`, `tags`, or join tables:

| Logical collection                         | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `repositoryExampleRelationUsers`           | Owner and task-assignee targets             |
| `repositoryExampleRelationProjects`        | Root records with all four relation types   |
| `repositoryExampleRelationProjectProfiles` | Unique nullable project key for hasOne      |
| `repositoryExampleRelationTasks`           | Nullable project key for hasMany            |
| `repositoryExampleRelationTags`            | Shared belongsToMany targets                |
| `repositoryExampleRelationProjectTags`     | Join records with a writable `role` payload |

`projects.owner` is belongsTo, `projects.profile` is hasOne, `projects.tasks` is hasMany, and `projects.tags` is belongsToMany through the prefixed join collection. `tasks.assignee` adds one nested belongsTo. The seed supplies stable `project-1`, `project-other`, `user-1`, `user-2`, profile, task and tag records matching the relationship-write documentation's scenarios.

## Repository HTTP API

`server/routes/index.ts` explicitly exposes Repository actions for the five CRM/order repositories, the atomic counter and the relationship examples. Each request is JSON over `POST /api/<repository>:<action>` (with any application mount prefix). The relationship collections expose only `findMany`, `findOne`, `createOne` and `updateOne`, which are the actions used by that page.

| Action      | Visible example                                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `findMany`  | Table, text filter AST, sort AST, offset/limit pagination               |
| `findOne`   | View details / open editor, including related records with a select AST |
| `count`     | Filtered result count and pagination                                    |
| `exists`    | Look up by ID                                                           |
| `createOne` | New record, relationship `connect`                                      |
| `updateOne` | Edit record; orders send `ifVersion`                                    |
| `deleteOne` | Explicit deletion confirmation; orders send `ifVersion`                 |

Expand **Repository calls** to inspect the last seven request/result pairs. These are observational examples of the real API calls, not a second implementation of CRUD.

```ts
import { apiClientToken } from '@nocobase/app-client';

const api = app.services.resolve(apiClientToken);
const orders = api.repository('repositoryExampleOrders');
const created = await orders.createOne({
  values: {
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    number: 'SO-001',
    status: 'draft',
    customer: { connect: { id: customerId } },
  },
});
await orders.updateOne({
  filter: { id: created.record.id },
  values: { status: 'confirmed' },
  ifVersion: created.version,
});
```

See `client/model.ts` for the JSON select/filter ASTs and relationship mutation values. `client/pages/repository-page.tsx` drives the same seven actions for each entity. There are no handwritten CRUD HTTP handlers.

## Relationship writes

Open **Repository examples → Relationship writes** at `/repository-example/relation-mutations`. The first panel reads the deterministic seeded graph, including owner, profile, tasks, tags and `projectTags.role` payloads.

**Run complete relationship write** creates a new isolated graph and then applies three root mutations through `api.repository('repositoryExampleRelationProjects')`:

1. `createOne` connects an owner and tag while creating a profile and tasks.
2. `updateOne` changes the owner and profile, then combines task `create`, `connect`, `disconnect`, `update`, `upsert` and `delete`; tag `connect` and `create` include through payloads.
3. A separate `updateOne` uses tag `set`, because `set` cannot be mixed with other operations on the same relation.

The result panel selects all four relationships. Lifetime checks independently query removed targets to show that task `disconnect` and tag `set` preserve their targets, while task `delete` removes its target. Omitting the through payload for the retained Documentation tag preserves its existing `secondary` role. Each run uses UUID-derived IDs and adds a new project, so the same page can be run repeatedly without reusing exclusive hasOne/hasMany targets.

Each HTTP root mutation is transactional, but the whole multi-request walkthrough is not one cross-request transaction. The integration test separately verifies that a failing nested `createOne` rolls back its root and child writes, and that relation-scoped update cannot modify `task-outside`, which belongs to `project-other`.

The actual inputs and responses are in `client/relation-mutations.ts` and are shown under **Repository calls**. No example-specific Server handler exists: the prefixed repositories use the same authenticated `defineRepositoryApiRoutes` contribution as the other examples.

## findMany arrays and streams

Open **Repository examples → findMany: array and stream** at `/repository-example/find-many`. A dedicated migration creates `repositoryExampleFindManyRecords`; its seed inserts 24 deterministic records so ordering and completeness are easy to inspect.

Both panels create the same query with `limit: 24` and ascending `sequence` sorting. Only the way the returned query is consumed changes:

```ts
const repository = api.repository<FindManyRecord>(
  'repositoryExampleFindManyRecords',
);

const records = await repository.findMany(options);

for await (const record of repository.findMany(options)) {
  consume(record);
}
```

Awaiting uses `Accept: application/json` and resolves with the complete array. Async iteration uses `Accept: application/x-ndjson`; the client decodes framed records and yields each one in order. Each call creates a new query because a single query cannot mix the two consumption modes. The collection exposes only `findMany`, is limited to 100 records per request, and is protected by the same required-authentication middleware as the other examples.

## Atomic numeric updates

Open **Repository examples → Atomic numeric updates** at `/repository-example/atomic`. A separate migration creates `repositoryExampleAtomicCounters` (`id`, `name`, non-null integer `value`). A separate transactional seed inserts four stable records without overwriting existing IDs:

| Record        | Initial value | Example                                  |
| ------------- | ------------: | ---------------------------------------- |
| `demo-stock`  |           120 | Receive units; guarded stock deduction   |
| `demo-wallet` |         50000 | Top up or spend integer cents            |
| `demo-points` |           100 | Add points; multiply by two              |
| `demo-visits` |             0 | One increment; ten concurrent increments |

Apply application migrations and seeds after updating the plugin. An empty page explains this prerequisite and disables mutation controls until its records exist. Completed seeds are skipped, preserving edits.

The authenticated `defineRepositoryApiRoutes` declaration exposes this collection too. The page sends `updateOne` with `values: { value: { increment: amount } }`, `decrement`, or `multiply: 2`. It never calculates an absolute replacement value from a browser read. Guarded deductions include `value >= amount` in the same update filter as the ID; no match returns 404 and changes nothing. This protects these page actions, while the shared example API remains a general Repository demonstration.

The concurrency action sends ten independent increments and reports every result with `Promise.allSettled`. Each successful request commits independently; there is no automatic retry. The page reloads the database value even when some requests fail. Other signed-in users share these counters, so the displayed total can also include their updates. Operands are positive integers up to 1,000,000; balance values are cents.

Tests verify authentication, integer validation, concurrent increments without lost updates, competing deductions from the last unit, seed replay, and page operations through real HTTP and SQLite.

## Aggregate queries

Open **Repository examples → Aggregate queries** at `/repository-example/aggregate`. The page reuses the seeded orders, items, products and customers; no additional migration or seed is required.

- `aggregate`: item row count, summed quantity, average/minimum/maximum unit price in cents.
- Enum `groupBy`: order counts by status in a single query, preserving exact enum member identity.
- `groupBy`: items grouped by `productId`, with row count, summed quantity and average unit price, sorted by quantity descending. Product names, SKUs and detail links accompany each group.
- `having`: a minimum grouped quantity applies after aggregation, without changing the overall statistics.
- Relation aggregate selection: the first 50 customers by ID with their matching order count, including zero counts and customer detail links.

The status Select filters every panel, including items through `order.status`. Apply runs the query again; Repository calls shows the actual request and response. Empty sets return count 0 and NULL for SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX. Average price is the unweighted average of item unit prices, not revenue or a quantity-weighted average. Queries run separately, so concurrent edits may be observed between panels.

The page calls `api.repository(name).aggregate()` and `.groupBy()` directly through `defineRepositoryApiRoutes`. Both actions are explicitly enabled and guarded by the plugin's authentication middleware. They use POST requests with Aggregate, Filter and Sort JSON ASTs, matching the database Repository contract. The old example-specific GET aggregate endpoint has been removed. The HTTP adapter validates the envelope and Repository validates fields, aliases and expressions.

The complete client calls are in `client/aggregate.ts`. Product names are fetched in batches of 100 to respect the configured list limit. The request trace shows each actual action and its JSON AST.

```ts
const items = api.repository<Record<string, unknown>>(
  'repositoryExampleOrderItems',
);
const summary = await items.aggregate({
  aggregate: {
    kind: 'aggregate',
    version: 1,
    items: [
      { kind: 'count', alias: 'count' },
      { kind: 'sum', field: 'quantity', alias: 'quantity' },
      { kind: 'avg', field: 'unitPriceCents', alias: 'averagePrice' },
    ],
  },
});
const groups = await items.groupBy({
  by: ['productId'],
  aggregate: {
    kind: 'aggregate',
    version: 1,
    items: [{ kind: 'sum', field: 'quantity', alias: 'quantity' }],
  },
  having: {
    kind: 'filter',
    version: 1,
    root: {
      kind: 'group',
      logic: 'and',
      items: [
        { kind: 'condition', path: ['quantity'], operator: '$gte', value: 3 },
      ],
    },
  },
  sort: {
    kind: 'sort',
    version: 1,
    items: [{ kind: 'field', path: ['quantity'], direction: 'desc' }],
  },
});
```

Unmodified seed data yields 8 item rows, quantity 14, average price 14900 cents, minimum 5900 and maximum 32900. Selecting Paid yields 3 item rows and quantity 5; a grouped minimum of 2 retains Keyboard and Mouse. Tests verify these results through real HTTP/SQLite and page interactions, along with authentication, invalid input, empty sets, and failure recovery.

## Additional groupBy examples

The Aggregate page includes three additional interactive panels using the same
seed data and authenticated Repository HTTP actions:

| Panel                     | Group keys                    | Metrics and ordering                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer order ranking    | `customerId`                  | COUNT, sorted by count descending then customer ID                                     |
| Customer × order status   | `customerId`, `status`        | COUNT per combination, sorted by count descending then customer ID                     |
| Product × item unit price | `productId`, `unitPriceCents` | COUNT and SUM(quantity), sorted by quantity descending, product ID and price ascending |

The status Select filters source rows in all panels. **Minimum rows per group**
applies `HAVING count >= minimum` to these three panels; the existing grouped
quantity threshold still applies only to the original product summary. Customer
and product IDs are resolved to names with detail links, in batches of at most 100. Each panel exposes its actual request AST and raw groupBy result.

With unchanged seeds and minimum count 1, customer ranking contains 3 customers,
customer/status contains 4 groups, and product/price contains 7 groups. Ada has
2 orders overall but only 1 per status. Keyboard has separate groups at 11900
and 12900 cents. With minimum count 2, ranking retains Ada, customer/status is
empty, and product/price retains the USB-C Dock with 2 rows and quantity 2.
Selecting Paid with minimum count 2 yields no groups in these panels.

These examples demonstrate that WHERE filters before grouping, HAVING filters
after grouping, multiple keys identify a combination, and COUNT(rows) differs
from SUM(quantity). Orders without matches do not generate a group; this differs
from the customer relation-count panel, which also includes zero-order customers.
`client/group-by.ts` owns the calls and `client/components/group-by-examples.tsx`
renders the panels. No new schema or seed is needed for these examples.

## Access and limits

Every exposed endpoint installs the authentication plugin's `required()` middleware. This is an intentionally shared example workspace: **every signed-in user can read and modify all example records**. There is no tenant isolation or per-role authorization in this example. Client pages independently require sign-in. Middleware applies only to the declared endpoints and does not protect or interfere with unrelated routes.

`defineRepositoryApiRoutes` enforces its standard JSON validation and 1 MiB request limit. Lists allow at most 100 records per request; the table uses 10. Relationship selectors fetch subsequent pages instead of silently hiding records after the first 100. Unknown collections and actions are not exposed. Concurrent order edits return `409 VERSION_CONFLICT` and the page asks the user to reload; it never silently retries and overwrites another update.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm --filter @nocobase/app-plugin-repository-example check
```

Tests run a real SQLite migration and rollback, inspect physical schema and relationship metadata, invoke CRUD, relationship mutations and aggregate/groupBy actions through the HTTP client, verify all authentication boundaries, relation scope, rollback, target lifetime, constraints and version conflicts, and exercise browser pages against the same real HTTP/SQLite fixture. Authentication sessions are stubbed in those fixtures; the real authentication middleware is executed.

The plugin uses shared development presets and plugin-local shadcn primitives. Its styles use the host's theme tokens and are included by the Default Template's enabled-plugin Tailwind scan.
