# @nocobase/app-plugin-repository-example

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- 90a4903: Add a Repository API example plugin with relational CRM and order tables, transactional sample data seeds, authenticated CRUD endpoints, and localized management pages with grouped navigation, detail child routes and create/edit drawers, product-aware order details and nested order-item creation. Include an atomic numeric update playground with seeded counters, guarded deductions and concurrent increments. Add aggregate statistics, status filters, product grouping with HAVING, and customer relation counts over the seeded orders. Enable the example in the Default Template.
- 90a4903: Add self-contained migrations and deterministic seed data for six prefixed relationship-write example collections.
- 90a4903: Add a seeded example page comparing array and streamed `findMany` consumption.
- 90a4903: Add an authenticated interactive page demonstrating nested and incremental Repository HTTP relationship writes, including through payloads and target lifetime checks.
- 566492d: Replace the combined relationship-write walkthrough with independent forms and tables for create, connect, disconnect, set, update, upsert, and delete. Support hasOne, hasMany, and many-to-many examples with isolated targets, through-role inputs, request previews, and explicit relationship and target-lifetime feedback. Expand the example repositories' nested-write allowlists to cover these operations.
- 566492d: Add five interactive select combine examples covering independent branches, relation aggregates, nested selections, shared and branch-local filters, and many-to-many relations, with tabular results, nested record tables, and inspectable JSON requests and responses.
- 566492d: Add interactive Repository sorting examples covering field order, stable ties, NULL placement, relation paths and aggregates, local include ordering, and invalid sort targets, with builder snippets, serialized requests, and tabular results.

### Patch Changes

- 90a4903: Support enum fields as Repository groupBy keys with exact member identity across database collations, nullable groups and stored-value validation. Preserve existing enum ordering restrictions. Replace per-status aggregate queries in the Repository example with a single enum groupBy request.
- 90a4903: Add server-owned writePolicy for single and bulk creates/updates, root upserts and
  mutation preflight. Internal Repository calls default to true. Explicit policies
  restrict scalar fields, each relation operation, nested create/update/upsert branches
  and through payloads before any writes. Add buildWritePolicy, buildUpsertWritePolicy
  and synchronous callback input, frozen snapshots and structured policy errors.

  Replace defineRepositoryApiRoutes action arrays with configuration objects and move
  maxLimit to actions.findMany. API create/update actions default to writePolicy false
  and require explicit allowlists; true and client-supplied policies are rejected.
  Return HTTP 403 for forbidden writes and migrate the Repository example's routes,
  fixtures and integration guidance to field and relationship policies.

- 90a4903: Align example filter and sort ASTs with the stricter Repository input types, including aggregate relation filters.
- 90a4903: Extend the aggregate page with customer order ranking, customer/status and product/price grouping examples. Add interactive row-count HAVING filters, readable relation links and per-panel request/result traces using the existing seed data.
- 90a4903: Expose opt-in aggregate and groupBy Repository HTTP actions with JSON AST validation, grouped filters and sorting, and lossless BigInt result serialization. Add matching remote Repository methods and public types. Switch the aggregate example to the generic authenticated endpoints and display its actual Repository requests.
