## 0.1.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- ceb356b: Fix published package metadata and database test driver registration.
- c960d07: Replace the Repository API's per-action `writePolicy` with a Repository Policy
  declared once per exposure.

  **Breaking.** `defineRepositoryApiRoutes()` no longer accepts `writePolicy` on
  an action, and every exposure must declare a `policy`. An action configuration
  now says only that an endpoint exists; what it may do is the exposure's Policy,
  which governs reading, creating, updating and deleting together. Declaring one
  is required rather than optional because `writePolicy` defaulted to refusing
  writes while an absent Policy restricts nothing — making it optional would have
  turned every existing declaration from "refuse every write" into "allow
  everything" without a word of warning.

  Declare `policy` as a function of a principal, together with a
  `principal(context)` resolver, to scope rows to the caller. The resolver belongs
  to the application, since this router installs no authentication; one that
  returns nothing refuses the request with 403 `PRINCIPAL_REQUIRED` rather than
  binding a Policy built from a principal that is not there. A fixed Policy is
  still normalized when the routes are defined, so a malformed one fails where it
  is written; a Policy function cannot be, and its `INVALID_POLICY` now reaches
  the host error handler as a server error instead of being reported to the caller
  as a 400.

  `@nocobase/db` gains `buildRepositoryPolicy`, a builder whose unmentioned nodes
  are denied, so the four-node requirement costs nothing to satisfy while the
  default stays refusal. Two related fixes travel with it: `create`, `update` and
  `delete` nodes that are `false` now refuse a write before its payload is read,
  so an empty body is reported as forbidden rather than as invalid input; and a
  `create` node whose relations grant `update`, `upsert`, `disconnect`, `set` or
  `delete` is refused during normalization, since a root create performs none of
  them.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-file` exposures declare a Policy too, and it reaches
  uploads: the upload path binds a Policy derived from the exposure's, inheriting
  `create.scope` and `create.defaults` and substituting the file columns for the
  field allowlist. A file uploaded under a scoped Policy therefore lands inside
  the scope the same exposure reads from. The public content route under
  `accessPath` is unchanged and deliberately outside it.

  The method-level `writePolicy` option on `db.repository()` calls is unaffected
  and remains available for narrowing a single call.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- 52d1107: Resolve the shared UI packages through the workspace catalog: `@base-ui/react`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, `shadcn`, `tailwind-merge`, and `tw-animate-css`.

  Every package already agreed on one version for each of these — the catalog is what keeps them agreeing. A range edited in one manifest and not the others would otherwise put two copies of a UI primitive into an application's bundle, which is the kind of drift nothing reports until a component behaves differently depending on which plugin rendered it.

  Peer dependencies use `catalog:` too. `pnpm pack` resolves it before publishing, so a consumer still reads an ordinary range.

- 52d1107: Declare the packages each plugin's browser code imports as peer dependencies, so an application that installs the plugin can resolve them while a server deployment installs none of them.

  A plugin's `client/` is not bundled by the plugin: `build` is `tsc`, so `dist/client/*.js` keeps its bare imports and the consuming application's Vite build resolves them. That application has only what the published manifest declares, and npm does not publish `devDependencies` — so a client import declared only there fails with `Could not resolve "…"`. `sonner` and `@xyflow/react` both shipped that way. Ten of these plugins appeared to work only because `app-template-default` happened to declare the same package for its own use; `@nocobase/app-plugin-hub`'s CodeMirror imports had no such coincidence and were unresolvable wherever it was installed.

  Peer dependencies are what satisfy both sides. An application installs one shared copy, and a deployment — which sets `autoInstallPeers: false` — installs none, so packages a server never requires stay out of it. Each keeps a matching devDependency so the workspace still resolves it and the version used here stays pinned. None is marked `optional`: an optional peer is not auto-installed anywhere, including in the application that needs it.

  `create-plugin` emits the same shape and its generated `AGENTS.md` teaches it, so a plugin created tomorrow declares its browser packages as peers rather than repeating the mistake.

- 52d1107: Declare each peer dependency once, dropping the devDependency that used to accompany it.

  The pairing was required on the grounds that a peer range is wide enough for development to drift off this repository's copy. It is not: pnpm installs a peer and links it into the plugin's own `node_modules`, resolving `workspace:^` to the same package `workspace:*` would. A plugin with the devDependency removed still links, typechecks, builds, and tests against it — verified against a clean install with every plugin's `node_modules` deleted first.

  What remained was a second declaration that changed nothing and had to be kept in step with the first. `pnpm peers:check` no longer asks for it, and `create-plugin` no longer emits it.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- 9536bf5: Reach the API client through `@nocobase/app-client` instead of importing `@nocobase/api-client` directly from the example plugin's client code. The plugin value-imported `ApiClientError` and `buildFindManyOptions` from a package it declares only as a `devDependency`, which resolved solely because pnpm happened to hoist that package for another consumer. `ApiClientError` is also compared with `instanceof`, so a second copy would make the check silently return false and leave `error.code` undefined under code that looks correct. Re-export `buildFindManyOptions` alongside the existing `ApiClientError` so the plugin resolves both through the single copy the application already provides.

### Minor Changes

- 90a4903: Add a Repository API example plugin with relational CRM and order tables, transactional sample data seeds, authenticated CRUD endpoints, and localized management pages with grouped navigation, detail child routes and create/edit drawers, product-aware order details and nested order-item creation. Include an atomic numeric update playground with seeded counters, guarded deductions and concurrent increments. Add aggregate statistics, status filters, product grouping with HAVING, and customer relation counts over the seeded orders. Enable the example in the Default Template.
- 90a4903: Add self-contained migrations and deterministic seed data for six prefixed relationship-write example collections.
- 90a4903: Add a seeded example page comparing array and streamed `findMany` consumption.
- 90a4903: Add an authenticated interactive page demonstrating nested and incremental Repository HTTP relationship writes, including through payloads and target lifetime checks.
- 566492d: Replace the combined relationship-write walkthrough with independent forms and tables for create, connect, disconnect, set, update, upsert, and delete. Support hasOne, hasMany, and many-to-many examples with isolated targets, through-role inputs, request previews, and explicit relationship and target-lifetime feedback. Expand the example repositories' nested-write allowlists to cover these operations.
- 566492d: Add five interactive select combine examples covering independent branches, relation aggregates, nested selections, shared and branch-local filters, and many-to-many relations, with tabular results, nested record tables, and inspectable JSON requests and responses.
- 566492d: Add interactive Repository sorting examples covering field order, stable ties, NULL placement, relation paths and aggregates, local include ordering, and invalid sort targets, with builder snippets, serialized requests, and tabular results.

### Patch Changes

- 90a4903: Support enum fields as Repository groupBy keys with exact member identity across database collations, nullable groups and stored-value validation. Preserve existing enum ordering restrictions. Replace per-status aggregate queries in the Repository example with a single enum groupBy request.
- 90a4903: Add server-owned writePolicy for single and bulk creates/updates, root upserts and
  mutation preflight. Internal Repository calls default to true. Explicit policies
  restrict scalar fields, each relation operation, nested create/update/upsert branches
  and through payloads before any writes. Add buildWritePolicy, buildUpsertWritePolicy
  and synchronous callback input, frozen snapshots and structured policy errors.

  Replace defineRepositoryApiRoutes action arrays with configuration objects and move
  maxLimit to actions.findMany. API create/update actions default to writePolicy false
  and require explicit allowlists; true and client-supplied policies are rejected.
  Return HTTP 403 for forbidden writes and migrate the Repository example's routes,
  fixtures and integration guidance to field and relationship policies.

- 90a4903: Align example filter and sort ASTs with the stricter Repository input types, including aggregate relation filters.
- 90a4903: Extend the aggregate page with customer order ranking, customer/status and product/price grouping examples. Add interactive row-count HAVING filters, readable relation links and per-panel request/result traces using the existing seed data.
- 90a4903: Expose opt-in aggregate and groupBy Repository HTTP actions with JSON AST validation, grouped filters and sorting, and lossless BigInt result serialization. Add matching remote Repository methods and public types. Switch the aggregate example to the generic authenticated endpoints and display its actual Repository requests.
