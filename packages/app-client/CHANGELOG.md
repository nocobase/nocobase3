## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- 062f5b1: Add `settings` to `defineClientPlugin`, a fourth contribution type alongside `bootstrap`, `routes`, and `providers`. A plugin points it at a module that default-exports an array of setting definitions, or a function of the plugin options returning one, and each entry becomes a page in the application's settings centre.

  An entry is either a page — `id`, `title`, an optional `icon` and `access` rule, and a `pageLoader` — or a group that carries an icon and title once for a set of pages. Ids are single URL segments and nesting comes from the tree, so a page under a group is served at `/settings/<group>/<page>`, and a plugin contributing one page declares it without a group and gets `/settings/<id>`. Groups nest one level. Settings and routes share one path space, so a route and a page that would mount at the same address fail resolution with both identities named.

  The default template renders the settings centre, reusing the application shell's chrome — brand, sidebar collapse, theme, and user menu — with `Back to app` where the workspace label sits and no gear pointing at itself. The left rail collapses by group the way the product sidebar does. A page whose `access` rule is denied is left out of the navigation and cannot be reached by its URL either, and a group whose pages are all denied disappears with them. A setting whose `access` rule is denied is left out of the navigation and cannot be reached by its URL either. Authorization's four administration pages now arrive this way, at the URLs they already had, and no longer appear in the product sidebar.

  `client:inspect` gains `--type settings`, and `pnpm plugin:create` scaffolds a `client/settings.ts` entry.

- c8f38c8: Register client plugins explicitly in the application's `client/plugins.ts` instead of discovering them from `nocobase.plugins` through a Vite virtual module.

  Each plugin now ships a `client/plugin.ts` descriptor, exported as `./client/plugin`, that declares its bootstrap, routes, providers, and route component overrides. An application composes them with `defineClientPlugins([...])`, where array order is bootstrap order and a plugin is enabled by being present. The entry is real, type-checked application source: it can be read, diffed, and edited, and Vite reloads it like any other module.

  Plugins can also accept options. `defineClientPlugin` takes an options type that reaches the bootstrap context, the routes and providers factories, and the route component overrides, so an application can pass a custom login page or a notification label at registration.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-registry-example` only drops its now-unread `nocobase.plugin.client` manifest field; it contributes no client extensions.

## 1.0.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- 0465323: Introduce the plugin-based authorization core and permission management UI. Replace the previous authorization API with composable core, database, permission-set, default-access, sharing-rule, restriction-rule, and page plugins; add route access metadata to the application client; publish and enable the authorization app plugin in the default template; and correct the Hub documentation to use the v3 Portal SDK package name.

## 1.0.0-beta.1

### Major Changes

- 509d812: Localize the shadcn UI components used by applications, plugins, and registries so they can customize their presentation independently. Remove the `@nocobase/app-client/ui` entry point and migrate its consumers to package-local components.
