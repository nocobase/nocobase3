// Archives the deployment build as `storage/dist.tar.gz`, for `pnpm build --tar`.
//
// The archive holds `dist/` as a directory rather than its contents, so extracting it anywhere produces a `dist/`
// alongside `config.example.yml` — the same two paths a deployment starts from, in the same relative positions they
// have in the application. Extracting into a directory that already holds work therefore adds a `dist/` rather than
// scattering `server/`, `client/`, and `node_modules/` across it.
//
// `config.example.yml` travels with it because a deployment has to write a `config.yml` before it can start, and the
// example is the only statement of what that file may contain. It is the one file outside `dist/` that a server needs.
//
// Uses the `tar` package rather than the `tar` command. A build runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows, whose tars are
// bsdtar, GNU tar, and a bundled bsdtar, and their `--exclude` patterns are anchored differently — a pattern that
// excludes the right paths on one can silently exclude nothing on another. `filter` is a callback, so what it matches
// does not depend on which tar the machine happens to have.

 * is worse than an absent one: `pnpm install` in the extracted tree reports a corrupt store rather than repairing it.
 *
 * `clean-dist-bin.mjs` already removes these before the archive is built, and nothing between the two puts one back —
 * `retarget-native.mjs` fetches binaries and renames extracted tarballs without running an install. This is the

 * them, and the resulting archive would fail only on a deployment.
