### Patch Changes

- d927494: Align shared application tooling and dependency declarations with Default while preserving Examples demonstrations and Hub management features. Remove duplicate and unused dependencies, correct repository metadata, and remove obsolete global OpenSSL options from Examples.

  Add Default's Users role scope, permission seed, and complete API Keys authentication integration to Examples. Remove unused workflow, notification, and heartbeat configuration and demonstration routes from Hub. Provide an explicit Playwright entry for the optional AI server test in Default and Examples, using the current API and a real test user's API key.

  Restore the shared Settings surface in Hub so its registered API Keys page is reachable for authorized users. Show the Settings entry only when an accessible navigation page exists across all three templates, correct stale template development and upgrade guidance, and resolve test dependencies through public package exports instead of monorepo-only source paths.

- f5b066d: Increase the compact theme's base corner radius from 0.25rem to 0.375rem for softer corners on controls and containers.
- 89955c5: Upgrade better-sqlite3 to ^13.0.3 and keep its dependency declaration in @nocobase/db-sqlite only. Remove redundant test dependencies from consumers so they use the same SQLite driver as applications.

  Preserve the bundled musl binary when building applications for Alpine Linux.

- 92c355f: Add build command help that exits before loading build dependencies or changing deployment artifacts. Record deployment target metadata even when no native modules are present, detect musl for current-machine Linux builds, and document the platform and Node fields available for deployment checks.

### Minor Changes

- 1a85a86: Add route breadcrumbs, nested child pages, and reusable page headers to the client and application templates.

### Patch Changes

- 63db898: Reorganize application database guidance around complete configuration factory examples. Clarify YAML overrides and SQLite paths, managed and external connections, default database selection, and verification that distinguishes reads from migrations. Keep driver installation and type inference details in troubleshooting guidance.
- 63db898: Exclude the application's complete build output from Vite file watching to prevent EMFILE errors after a build, while preserving hot updates for linked workspace dependencies.

  Check native file watching before development startup, fall back to polling with agent annotations disabled when native watchers are unavailable, and poll application configuration files so watcher resource errors no longer crash the development process.

- 63db898: Add `defineAppDatabaseConfig` to infer connection types from the drivers returned by a runtime configuration callback. Application templates now directly export this helper without explicit factory annotations, driver type maps, or `satisfies` clauses. Keep declaration emission but use full TypeScript inference for application server builds; library packages retain isolated declaration checking.
- a60decd: Require an explicit absolute baseDir for Server plugins and resolve migrations, seeds, jobs, and package metadata from the loaded plugin copy. Generate and validate database task manifests during builds so TypeScript and JavaScript share source checksums, with verified legacy JavaScript history conversion and synchronized plugin scaffolding and application templates.
- 63db898: Add a `database connections` reference to the application development Skill, covering how to switch the database and add a connection.

  Nothing documented this. `database-and-data.md` states in its first line that it is about reading and writing rows at runtime, and `migrations.md` covers per-connection migrations without saying how a connection comes to exist — so of the eight dialects the runtime supports, only SQLite was reachable from the documentation.

  The new page covers why a dialect is registered in `server/config/database.ts` rather than configured in `config.yml`, the four steps to switch the default connection, a table of every dialect with its package, native driver, default port and connection fields, which drivers install a native binary and which do not, and the fact that switching does not carry data across. It is routed from `SKILL.md` and `AGENTS.md` in each template.

  It also shows how to configure `kingbase`, `oceanbase` and `dameng`, whose connection shapes `@nocobase/db` does not declare, by naming them on `AppDatabaseConfig`.

- e067113: Depend on one zod major, so a deployment can resolve better-auth

  An application that installed both the AI employee plugin and the API keys plugin failed to start with `z.ipv4 is not a function`, thrown while loading `@better-auth/core`. Nothing in better-auth was wrong: the AI employee packages asked for `zod: ^3` while better-auth asks for `^4`, and a deployment installs `dist/` with `nodeLinker: hoisted`, where one version of a package takes the root slot and the rest are nested underneath whoever depends on them. zod 3 won the root, which forced better-auth's whole subtree to be nested, and a `@better-auth/core` that ended up next to the root zod bound to the wrong major.

  The same collision has a second failure mode that is harder to read. `@better-auth/api-key` declares `@better-auth/core`, `better-call`, `jose`, `kysely` and `nanostores` as peer dependencies, and a deployment sets `autoInstallPeers: false` so it installs none of them. It works anyway when better-auth's dependencies hoist to the root, because the peers are then sitting where the resolver looks; it stops working the moment the zod conflict pushes them down into `node_modules/better-auth/node_modules`, and the application fails with `Cannot find package '@better-auth/core'`.

  So the fix is not to declare better-auth's internals somewhere. `@nocobase/ai-employee` never imported zod at all and no longer declares it, `@nocobase/app-plugin-ai-employee` moves to zod 4, and all three templates and the plugin now take it from the `zod` catalog entry, so one version is what an application gets. Its schemas use `z.object`, `z.string`, `z.number`, `z.array`, `z.record`, `z.coerce`, `z.any` and `z.unknown`, all of which carry over unchanged; `buildStandardAgentMiddleware` gained an explicit `AgentMiddleware[]` return type, which the new resolution made necessary.

  A deployment tree now holds a single `zod` and a single `@better-auth/core`, hoisted to the root where `@better-auth/api-key` resolves them.

## 0.1.0-beta.8

### Patch Changes

- c258b92: Declare `auth.secret` and `session.secret` as live keys in `config.example.yml` rather than commented-out placeholders, and describe how a generated application's `config.yml` and database now come about.

  `@nocobase/create-app` generates `config.yml` from this file and fills the two secrets in. Leaving them commented meant the generator had to uncomment them, which made the exact comment syntax of this file part of its contract; a live key with a placeholder value is a target it can simply replace.

  The other way this file is used — copying it to `config.yml` by hand — is covered separately: the placeholder is a non-empty string that would otherwise pass for a configured secret, so the runtime now refuses it by name and says how to generate a replacement.

  The generator no longer asks which database to use, so "Review your configuration" in each README no longer says `config.yml` carries the database you chose. An application starts on SQLite, and another database means registering its dialect in `server/config/database.ts` and adding the matching `@nocobase/db-*` package — drivers are code rather than settings, and a dialect the application does not register cannot be introduced from `config.yml`.

  The Hub's upgrade skill no longer describes `app-dist/`, which the generator stopped creating and nothing reads.

## 0.1.0-beta.6

### Minor Changes

- 1d5ee9a: Add `pnpm collections:generate` for writing and checking Collection artifacts

  `pnpm nocobase app collections generate` reads every Collection of a managed connection and writes `collection.json`, `metadata.json` and `schema.json` under `database/<connection>/collections/<name>/`, plus a `_manifest.json` per connection recording the dialect, whether the schema is managed or external, and the last applied migration. `--connection` targets one connection, `--all` every configured one including external connections, and `--check` compares the result with the files on disk and exits non-zero on any difference without writing, which is what a CI step runs.

  The command is a thin entry over `generateAppCollectionsArtifact()` from `@nocobase/app-server`; the files are derived output for developers, documentation and AI tooling, and nothing reads them back at runtime. `AGENTS.md` and the README describe the directory.

- 1d5ee9a: Add an external database example

  The `externalCrm` connection reads a database another system owns: `schemaManagement: 'external'` keeps NocoBase from changing its schema, `naming` maps the CRM's `crm_`-prefixed tables to logical Collection names, and a `ModuleCollectionMetadataStore` fed from `database/externalCrm/metadata.ts` supplies titles and the `orders.customer` relation the schema cannot express. Two read-only repository routes, `crmCustomers` and `crmOrders`, expose it to signed-in users, and an **External CRM** page lists the orders with their customers through them.

  The connection points at a local SQLite file so the example runs without a real CRM; a provider plays the foreign system and creates the tables and sample rows when they are missing, and does nothing once the connection is pointed elsewhere.

### Patch Changes

- a153ad8: Add a read-only Database Explorer plugin and enable it in the Default and Examples templates.

  The Settings page browses the application's database connections, the collections on each one, and their fields and physical columns. The two detail panes are child routes and the selection rides in the query string, so any view can be linked to and is restored by browser Back.

  Read-only means the plugin creates, alters or drops no collection and changes no row. One qualifier: reading a collection initializes the collection registry, whose metadata store creates `__nocobase_collection_metadata` on a managed connection when it is missing, so that one bookkeeping table is the only object a read can bring into existence — and only when the first NocoBase activity against a database is an Explorer read. External connections cannot reach that path. A test states this boundary against a real database rather than assuming it.

  Listing connections reads configuration and opens no database, so one unreachable external connection cannot take down the page. A connection reports its dialect, schema management, logical database, schemas, naming options, and internal tables, and never its credentials, host, port, socket path, or SQLite file — enforced as an allow-list, so a field a new dialect introduces stays inside by default. Driver errors are withheld from responses and recorded in logs by classification only, never by message or cause.

  The collections list follows the server's cursor to the end so its client-side search sees every collection, and says so when a connection exceeds the bound.

  Every endpoint requires `page:database-explorer/access`, the grant the page and both of its panes declare, which the seeded System Administrator permission set covers.

- 1d5ee9a: Keep the external CRM example's metadata in `metadata.json` files

  The `externalCrm` connection no longer constructs a `ModuleCollectionMetadataStore` from TypeScript documents. Its metadata lives in `database/externalCrm/collections/{customers,orders}/metadata.json`, the default source for an external connection, so the connection is configured by `dialect`, `schemaManagement` and `naming` alone. The build copies these files into `dist/database` so a deployment resolves the same titles and relations.

- 22d0d2a: Resolve client chunk URLs at run time so a built application works wherever it is mounted.

  Vite bakes `base` into the bundle at build time, while an App Host mounts a deployed application under its own App ID. A build made for `/main` and deployed as `/crm` therefore asked for `/main/assets/<chunk>.js` and got a 404 for every chunk the browser had to fetch at run time, which is every lazily imported route: the application loaded, its shell rendered, and each lazy page failed with "Route … could not be loaded". Pages whose chunks `index.html` preloads kept working, so the failure looked like it belonged to a particular plugin rather than to the deployment.

  Only the URLs emitted into JavaScript become runtime-relative, resolved against `import.meta.url`; every chunk sits beside the entry chunk, so this is correct at any mount path. The URLs in `index.html` stay absolute: the document is served at arbitrary SPA route depths where a relative URL would resolve against the current route, and the Host rewrites those root-relative attributes to the mount path, which it can only do while they start with `/`.

  Applications generated from these templates need to rebuild to pick this up. No configuration changes, and a build deployed at the path it was built for behaves as before.

- 73f7538: Resolve a Portal build's asset URLs from the runtime base path so a build keeps working when a host mounts it under a different prefix. Vite inlined the build-time `base` into its `__vitePreload` helper, and that helper awaits every stylesheet link it inserts, so a lazy chunk carrying its own CSS rejected its dynamic import and rendered the route's error state once the application was served from somewhere other than the prefix it was built for.

  The templates each carried their own copy of this fix, added before it existed in the shared configuration. They now inherit it from `createPortalViteConfig` instead. A consumer that configures `experimental.renderBuiltUrl` itself still overrides the shared one, so nothing that needs its own strategy loses it — the templates simply no longer need one.

### Minor Changes

- ceb356b: Add an independent analytics database with channel, campaign, and daily metric examples, deterministic initial data, and authenticated Repository API routes for CRUD and aggregation.
- ceb356b: Add an application-owned numeric types example with a migrated table, repeatable initial data, and an authenticated page comparing Query and Repository reads and aggregates.
- ceb356b: Add runnable quotation routing, analytics daily report, and failure diagnostic workflows, with a homepage entry, idempotent report storage, and usage examples.
- 0f80d52: Support PROXY_TARGET_URL during development to run the local Vite client against another application's API and WebSocket service, including browser origin handling for authentication, without starting a local backend.
- 3bb34a3: Add RouteDialog and RouteDrawer with guarded closing and a shared useRouteOverlay hook. The wrappers insert no child outlet: the page that owns a child route places one itself, so an overlay can render its next child wherever the page needs it. Include route overlay examples and application development guidance.

### Patch Changes

- ceb356b: Declare database dialect drivers on the application's own database config.

  An application lists the dialect packages it installs under `database.drivers`,
  next to the connections that use them, and the runtime, the CLI commands and the
  tests all resolve a dialect from that one place. The app-server runtime stays
  independent of every concrete database driver.

  This replaces the process-wide `registerAppDatabaseDrivers` registry and the
  `databaseDrivers` option on `Application`, both of which are removed. An
  application that used either one moves its drivers into `database.drivers` and
  drops the module it imported only for the registration side effect.

- f17f3a6: Provide editable TypeScript defaults for application modules, assembled by the runtime before services start. Module factories receive the runtime with application paths and plugin metadata; deployment files and environment variables override defaults, and configuration reload preserves code defaults.

  Keep deployment settings in YAML examples and reserve explicit environment overrides for secrets and startup integration. Simplify application configuration loading, merging and reload subscriptions.

  Align client configuration assembly with the server: runtime merges application TypeScript defaults beneath public configuration before services start. Client inspection reports the application configuration entry.

- f17f3a6: Move the password authentication pages to the application. The authentication plugin keeps only the protocol, session state, guards and headless actions: it no longer declares `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password` or `/reset-password`, drops the `client/routes` and `client/route-contracts` entries, and removes the `loginPage`/`registerPage` route override options.

  Each application template now declares those four guest routes in `client/routes.ts` and loads the application-owned pages from `client/pages/auth/`, which compose the preinstalled UI from `client/extensions/nocobase-auth-ui/`. The pages use ordinary relative links; URL handling remains with the application router and basename.

- f17f3a6: Support TypeScript authentication options in application templates and use the native authentication client. Keep authentication plugins and callbacks in editable server and client configuration, with YAML as the default format for deployment settings.

  Runtime assembly now prepares complete configuration before application creation. Module configuration factories use defineAppConfig and defaultAppConfigs, receive the runtime once, and retain their defaults when environment configuration reloads.

- ceb356b: Supply plugin migration and seed sources to database planning directly instead
  of through the database configuration.

  `AppDatabaseConfig.taskSources` is removed. It held the application's package
  name and the migration and seed directories contributed by registered server
  plugins — values the runtime derives from resolved plugins rather than values
  anyone configures. Carrying them in the `database` namespace put them where a
  `config.yml` deep-merges: `database.taskSources.migrations: []` silently
  dropped every plugin's migrations, and the application still started.

  They now travel as an `AppDatabaseTaskContributions` value alongside the
  configuration. `planAppDatabaseTasks`, `runAppDatabaseTasks`, `runAppMigrations`
  and `runAppSeeds` take an options object carrying it, with `paths`, `drivers`
  and the task selection, in place of their positional parameters.
  `createAppPluginDatabaseConfig` and `resolveAppPluginDatabaseConfig` are
  replaced by `createAppDatabaseTaskContributions`, which maps resolved plugins to
  that value. `contributions` is required, so a call site that has not been
  updated fails to compile rather than quietly planning without its plugins.

  An application's `server/config/database.ts` keeps only what it configures —
  drivers and connections — and no longer calls into the plugin resolver. Its
  `cli/database-command.ts` builds the contributions from the runtime it already
  resolves; `cli/commands/migrate.ts` and `cli/commands/seed.ts` are unchanged.

- ceb356b: Restore the application route contribution order so route overlay examples are registered before the articles page.
- e11b855: Locate a built application's `config.yml` next to `dist/` when none exists inside it, build the client against the same `.env` files the server loads, and prefer the compiled dependency tree when resolving plugins from a production build.
- ceb356b: Add the destructive `pnpm migrate --fresh --force` workflow for managed
  connections. It clears dialect-owned schema objects, reruns visible migrations,
  requires confirmation in interactive terminals, and rejects external
  connections.
- bf0f05b: Replace the `plugin update --plugin` flag with an optional plugin name argument, supporting full package names and short names while preserving updates of all registered plugins when no name is supplied.

  Document the positional plugin update command, version-range behavior, and Skills synchronization in all three application templates' README, agent guidelines, and development Skill.

- f718a90: Honor APP_SERVER_PORT as the local Vite port during remote-backend development while retaining local backend port configuration in normal development.
- d566dde: Align the example and Hub templates with the AI resource packaging and deployment artifact pruning changes.
- ceb356b: Remove the Dameng/DMDB driver from the examples application so its default development configuration uses SQLite without requiring a local DMDB service, and provide a development Docker Compose file for the supported server-backed database dialects. Improve Oracle schema normalization so repeated nullable column changes are skipped across all column types, map integers with enough precision for the full 32-bit range, and accept the application's ISO timestamp seed format.
- c960d07: Replace the Repository API's per-action `writePolicy` with a Repository Policy
  declared once per exposure.

  **Breaking.** `defineRepositoryApiRoutes()` no longer accepts `writePolicy` on
  an action, and every exposure must declare a `policy`. An action configuration
  now says only that an endpoint exists; what it may do is the exposure's Policy,
  which governs reading, creating, updating and deleting together. Declaring one
  is required rather than optional because `writePolicy` defaulted to refusing
  writes while an absent Policy restricts nothing — making it optional would have
  turned every existing declaration from "refuse every write" into "allow
  everything" without a word of warning.

  Declare `policy` as a function of a principal, together with a
  `principal(context)` resolver, to scope rows to the caller. The resolver belongs
  to the application, since this router installs no authentication; one that
  returns nothing refuses the request with 403 `PRINCIPAL_REQUIRED` rather than
  binding a Policy built from a principal that is not there. A fixed Policy is
  still normalized when the routes are defined, so a malformed one fails where it
  is written; a Policy function cannot be, and its `INVALID_POLICY` now reaches
  the host error handler as a server error instead of being reported to the caller
  as a 400.

  `@nocobase/db` gains `buildRepositoryPolicy`, a builder whose unmentioned nodes
  are denied, so the four-node requirement costs nothing to satisfy while the
  default stays refusal. Two related fixes travel with it: `create`, `update` and
  `delete` nodes that are `false` now refuse a write before its payload is read,
  so an empty body is reported as forbidden rather than as invalid input; and a
  `create` node whose relations grant `update`, `upsert`, `disconnect`, `set` or
  `delete` is refused during normalization, since a root create performs none of
  them.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-file` exposures declare a Policy too, and it reaches
  uploads: the upload path binds a Policy derived from the exposure's, inheriting
  `create.scope` and `create.defaults` and substituting the file columns for the
  field allowlist. A file uploaded under a scoped Policy therefore lands inside
  the scope the same exposure reads from. The public content route under
  `accessPath` is unchanged and deliberately outside it.

  The method-level `writePolicy` option on `db.repository()` calls is unaffected
  and remains available for narrowing a single call.

## 0.1.0-beta.4

### Minor Changes

- a009e2d: Derive the languages an application offers from its own locale files, and configure the default language in one place.

  `i18n.defaultLocale` in `config.yml` now names the language the application starts in, for the browser and the server alike. The `i18n.locales` setting and its `APP_LOCALES` environment variable are removed, along with `client.app.defaultLocale`: an application offers whichever languages its own `client/locales/index.ts` and `server/locales/index.ts` declare loaders for, so adding a language means adding its file rather than editing a second list. A plugin's locale file supplies translations for those languages and no longer adds one, which keeps an installed plugin from putting an unexpected language in the picker.

  The browser resolves its startup language as the visitor's stored choice, then `i18n.defaultLocale`, then `en-US`. `navigator.language` is no longer consulted. Switching language in the interface remains a user-level choice and does not change the configured default.

  An untranslated key now falls back through `i18n.defaultLocale` and then `en-US`, rather than through the default alone. An application that defaults to Chinese and adds Spanish leaves its plugins translated in neither, and English is the language they are most likely to ship; the fallback languages are loaded alongside the one in use so the fallback has resources to read. `pnpm nocobase app i18n:check` reports a language declared in `client/locales/` but not `server/locales/`, or the reverse — the case where the interface offers a language the server then rejects.

  `LocaleResource` and `PartialLocaleResource` now accept an `overrides` block at the top level. The shape is derived from the source locale, which never declares that key, so annotating a locale file with it and adding the block documented for rewording a plugin's copy was a compile error — the documented example did not compile.

  To migrate, replace `i18n.locales` and `client.app.defaultLocale` with `i18n.defaultLocale`, and make sure every language the application offers has a file in its own `client/locales/` and `server/locales/`.

- e9f796d: Run plugin-registered commands during `pnpm build` and `pnpm dev`

  Both scripts now ask the application's CLI which commands its plugins have registered, and run them at the matching stage. The workflow Artifact build was written directly into these scripts and moves to the workflow plugin, which is what installs it; an application without that plugin no longer carries the step, and a plugin that needs one no longer requires an edit here.

  Failing to read the list fails the run: a build that silently skipped a hook would look successful while missing whatever the hook produces. Declaring no hooks is not that case and changes nothing.

### Patch Changes

- b90a65f: Keep the sidebar at viewport height

  On a tall page the desktop sidebar used to stretch along with the document, because it was a stretched flex item of a `min-h-svh` shell. Its navigation therefore never scrolled: the whole page moved instead, and the sidebar's header and footer drifted out of view. The sidebar now sticks to the viewport at a fixed height, and the menu scrolls inside it once its entries overflow. The same fix applies to the settings and dev-tools surface, which shares the layout.

- 426bd48: Remove logical IM `target` recipients and make `send().to` optional so Webhook Providers can be selected directly by Provider name or fan-out strategy.
- 1d59a9c: Add a template upgrade Skill and record the source template in the generated manifest.

  `skills/nocobase-app-upgrade/` describes how to merge a newer template release into an application generated from a template. It compares the two template releases to learn what changed, then decides file by file how each change lands in the application, so a customization is never reverted and a removal that breaks user code outside the changed files is caught before the upgrade is called done.

  `pnpm create @nocobase/app` now writes `nocobase.templatePackage` into the generated manifest, naming the template package the application came from. An upgrade needs it to know which template to diff: `name` becomes the application's own at generation, and `templateKind` does not distinguish the app templates from each other.

### Patch Changes

- f5b066d: Declare `@nocobase/db` and `@nocobase/service-provider` in `dependencies`, so a generated application can build its server

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- c3e02bf: Support client.app.defaultLocale, defaultColorScheme, and defaultTheme configuration while preserving saved user preferences and ignoring unsupported defaults.

### Patch Changes

- 1d042c0: Align the Examples template with nested routes and route-owned navigation.
- f79ab75: Remove type declarations, third-party source maps, and third-party documentation from the deployment build, cutting the archive an application deploys from by roughly 30%
- f5b066d: Add `pnpm build --tar`, which packs the deployment build and `config.example.yml` into `storage/dist.tar.gz`
- 1d042c0: Only display navigation icons when explicitly configured.
- 741d0eb: Remove the commercial AI Knowledge Base plugin dependency and default runtime composition from the open-source application templates.
- 1d042c0: Reset page loading and error state when navigating to another route.
- 0a3fa83: Always show the notification test action, use user-facing delivery method labels, and enforce its permission only when a test message is submitted.
- f5b066d: Document `pnpm build --tar` in the template README
- 5a891d7: Replace the File plugin's legacy backend and client protocol with File Repository services, multipart uploads, and configurable content routes. Preserve its editable Registry components and adapt them to ClientFileRepository and contentUrl. Remove the separate File Repository package, rename its example to app-plugin-file-example, and update application registration and Agent integration guidance.

  This is a breaking replacement of the old File API: access-token routes, inventory settings, FilesClient, and runtime component exports are removed. Applications own file collections and route security; metadata deletion retains storage objects. The example migration remains unchanged.

  Keep the File core in Default and the core plus app-plugin-file-example in Examples. Preserve Hub without a default File registration.

  Require the unified API version for Registry components, preserve PDF previews across cross-origin storage redirects, and normalize database file sizes to safe numeric values without treating custom record or records fields as response envelopes.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- 52d1107: Keep client packages out of the server deployment, and make every native binary match the platform being deployed to.

  A plugin's `client/` is compiled by the consuming application's Vite build, so the packages it imports have to be published in the plugin's manifest — but a server has no client build and never requires them. Plugins now declare those as peer dependencies, and the generated `dist/pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `autoInstallPeers: false`, so an application installs one shared copy while a deployment installs none. What reaches a server is decided by declarations rather than by analysis.

  Native binaries are compiled for one platform, architecture, C library, and Node ABI at once, so a build made on a Mac installs binaries a Linux server cannot load. `pnpm build` targets the machine it runs on, keeping `pnpm build && pnpm start` working; `--target linux-x64` (or `linux-arm64`, `linux-x64-musl`, `darwin-arm64`, `win32-x64`) and `--node-version` select another. Each build states the platform it produced and records it in `dist/package.json` under `nocobase.buildTarget`.

  The build then verifies its own result: it fails when a package the application's own server, database, or CLI code imports would not reach a deployment. It reads literal specifiers, so an import whose name is assembled at run time is invisible to it and has to be declared deliberately.

  Add `pnpm server:deps:retarget` and `pnpm server:deps:verify`, which run the two steps on their own.

### Patch Changes

- 52d1107: Declare the packages an application's server, database, and CLI code imports in `dependencies` rather than `devDependencies`, and generate `dist/package.json` from that declaration instead of by scanning the built output.

  The scan existed because the declaration did not: with every package in `devDependencies`, nothing could tell which of them a deployment needed, so the build walked `dist/server` for bare imports and expanded each transitive dependency by hand. With the declaration correct, `pnpm install` applies the same rules — a plugin's `dependencies` come along, its `peerDependencies` are skipped by `autoInstallPeers: false`, and `devDependencies` were never published — and a scan that resolves specifiers is a scan that can miss one.

- 52d1107: Resolve the shared UI packages through the workspace catalog: `@base-ui/react`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, `shadcn`, `tailwind-merge`, and `tw-animate-css`.

  Every package already agreed on one version for each of these — the catalog is what keeps them agreeing. A range edited in one manifest and not the others would otherwise put two copies of a UI primitive into an application's bundle, which is the kind of drift nothing reports until a component behaves differently depending on which plugin rendered it.

  Peer dependencies use `catalog:` too. `pnpm pack` resolves it before publishing, so a consumer still reads an ordinary range.
