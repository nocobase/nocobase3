# @nocobase/app-template-examples

## 0.0.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- d29d1fe: Add an independent Examples application template based on Default, with a localized examples homepage, article management, initial data, and registered capability examples. Add the `examples` template alias to create-app and include the template in release version synchronization.
- d29d1fe: Register Workflow commands in the application CLI and build workflow artifacts through `pnpm nocobase workflow build`.
- f5b066d: Fix development startup by building workflows through the application CLI instead of the removed standalone workflow command.
- d29d1fe: Remove the system information plugin package from the workspace and all application templates. Remove its client page, server API, plugin registrations, dependencies, synchronized Skills and integration test references. Document the source upgrade and use a new plugin name in the scaffolding tutorial.
- d29d1fe: Align plugin discovery, development watches, and deployment packaging with the CLI composition roots and remove duplicate plugin manifest metadata.
- d29d1fe: Remove `@nocobase/app-plugin-file` from all application templates, including client/server registration, direct dependencies, test fixtures and installed-plugin guidance. The plugin's file inventory settings page and API are no longer included by default. Preserve stored files and independently registered file Repository capabilities.
