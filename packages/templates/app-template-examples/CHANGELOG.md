# @nocobase/app-template-examples

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- c3e02bf: Support client.app.defaultLocale, defaultColorScheme, and defaultTheme configuration while preserving saved user preferences and ignoring unsupported defaults.

### Patch Changes

- 1d042c0: Align the Examples template with nested routes and route-owned navigation.
- f79ab75: Remove type declarations, third-party source maps, and third-party documentation from the deployment build, cutting the archive an application deploys from by roughly 30%
- f5b066d: Add `pnpm build --tar`, which packs the deployment build and `config.example.yml` into `storage/dist.tar.gz`
- 1d042c0: Only display navigation icons when explicitly configured.
- 741d0eb: Remove the commercial AI Knowledge Base plugin dependency and default runtime composition from the open-source application templates.
- 1d042c0: Reset page loading and error state when navigating to another route.
- 0a3fa83: Always show the notification test action, use user-facing delivery method labels, and enforce its permission only when a test message is submitted.
- f5b066d: Document `pnpm build --tar` in the template README
- 5a891d7: Replace the File plugin's legacy backend and client protocol with File Repository services, multipart uploads, and configurable content routes. Preserve its editable Registry components and adapt them to ClientFileRepository and contentUrl. Remove the separate File Repository package, rename its example to app-plugin-file-example, and update application registration and Agent integration guidance.

  This is a breaking replacement of the old File API: access-token routes, inventory settings, FilesClient, and runtime component exports are removed. Applications own file collections and route security; metadata deletion retains storage objects. The example migration remains unchanged.

  Keep the File core in Default and the core plus app-plugin-file-example in Examples. Preserve Hub without a default File registration.

  Require the unified API version for Registry components, preserve PDF previews across cross-origin storage redirects, and normalize database file sizes to safe numeric values without treating custom record or records fields as response envelopes.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- 52d1107: Keep client packages out of the server deployment, and make every native binary match the platform being deployed to.

  A plugin's `client/` is compiled by the consuming application's Vite build, so the packages it imports have to be published in the plugin's manifest — but a server has no client build and never requires them. Plugins now declare those as peer dependencies, and the generated `dist/pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `autoInstallPeers: false`, so an application installs one shared copy while a deployment installs none. What reaches a server is decided by declarations rather than by analysis.

  Native binaries are compiled for one platform, architecture, C library, and Node ABI at once, so a build made on a Mac installs binaries a Linux server cannot load. `pnpm build` targets the machine it runs on, keeping `pnpm build && pnpm start` working; `--target linux-x64` (or `linux-arm64`, `linux-x64-musl`, `darwin-arm64`, `win32-x64`) and `--node-version` select another. Each build states the platform it produced and records it in `dist/package.json` under `nocobase.buildTarget`.

  The build then verifies its own result: it fails when a package the application's own server, database, or CLI code imports would not reach a deployment. It reads literal specifiers, so an import whose name is assembled at run time is invisible to it and has to be declared deliberately.

  Add `pnpm server:deps:retarget` and `pnpm server:deps:verify`, which run the two steps on their own.

### Patch Changes

- 52d1107: Declare the packages an application's server, database, and CLI code imports in `dependencies` rather than `devDependencies`, and generate `dist/package.json` from that declaration instead of by scanning the built output.

  The scan existed because the declaration did not: with every package in `devDependencies`, nothing could tell which of them a deployment needed, so the build walked `dist/server` for bare imports and expanded each transitive dependency by hand. With the declaration correct, `pnpm install` applies the same rules — a plugin's `dependencies` come along, its `peerDependencies` are skipped by `autoInstallPeers: false`, and `devDependencies` were never published — and a scan that resolves specifiers is a scan that can miss one.

- 52d1107: Resolve the shared UI packages through the workspace catalog: `@base-ui/react`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, `shadcn`, `tailwind-merge`, and `tw-animate-css`.

  Every package already agreed on one version for each of these — the catalog is what keeps them agreeing. A range edited in one manifest and not the others would otherwise put two copies of a UI primitive into an application's bundle, which is the kind of drift nothing reports until a component behaves differently depending on which plugin rendered it.

  Peer dependencies use `catalog:` too. `pnpm pack` resolves it before publishing, so a consumer still reads an ordinary range.

## 0.0.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- d29d1fe: Add an independent Examples application template based on Default, with a localized examples homepage, article management, initial data, and registered capability examples. Add the `examples` template alias to create-app and include the template in release version synchronization.
- d29d1fe: Register Workflow commands in the application CLI and build workflow artifacts through `pnpm nocobase workflow build`.
- f5b066d: Fix development startup by building workflows through the application CLI instead of the removed standalone workflow command.
- d29d1fe: Remove the system information plugin package from the workspace and all application templates. Remove its client page, server API, plugin registrations, dependencies, synchronized Skills and integration test references. Document the source upgrade and use a new plugin name in the scaffolding tutorial.
- d29d1fe: Align plugin discovery, development watches, and deployment packaging with the CLI composition roots and remove duplicate plugin manifest metadata.
- d29d1fe: Remove `@nocobase/app-plugin-file` from all application templates, including client/server registration, direct dependencies, test fixtures and installed-plugin guidance. The plugin's file inventory settings page and API are no longer included by default. Preserve stored files and independently registered file Repository capabilities.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Initial Examples application template, based on the Default application with article management and registered capability examples.
