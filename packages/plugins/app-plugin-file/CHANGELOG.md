# @nocobase/app-plugin-file

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- ac3f033: Export every server plugin from its package's `./server` entry point, and update application composition, plugin discovery, and generated plugins to use the unified entry point.

### Patch Changes

- ed39b69: Wait for file fixture initialization before shutting down an application.
- b0f0aa7: Preserve a user-uploaded File Demo avatar when reconciling default fixtures.
- ac3f033: Replace aggregated application configuration objects and config factories with typed module-owned configuration definitions. Applications now compose defaults, file providers, environment layers, validation, explicit reloads, and subscriptions through `AppConfig`, while providers read their configuration through `app.config.get(definition)`.
- fb1a752: Unify Client and Server application composition around the explicit `serviceProviders` contribution and rename Client React tree contributions to `reactProviders`.

  Replace Client bootstrap modules with application-owned ServiceProvider lifecycle hooks, make the default Client start through `ClientApplication` and render through the Browser host, and update built-in plugins and runtime inspection to the new static contribution protocol.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- 7cdffbd: Replace separate API and root route arrays with one ordered `routes` contribution array. Route factories now receive the Application, create and return their own Hono router, and are mounted automatically at `/api` or the application root according to their definition.

  Standardize plugin server modules around `providers/index.ts` and `routes/index.ts` collection entries, `services/` domain implementations, and a stable `tokens.ts` public contract.

  Generated plugins now declare conventional database and queue contribution directories by default. Missing optional directories are ignored until executable migrations, seeds, or jobs are added.

  Generated plugins now include an App-facing starter Agent Skill under the package's `skills/` directory. Plugin registration and skill synchronization copy these package-owned Skills into registered applications' `.agents/skills/` directories.

  Unify Client page contributions behind one `routes` loader. Plugins now use `defineAppRoutes()` and `defineSettingsRoutes()` to add child Routes to the application's two built-in Client Routes, mirroring how Server plugins use `defineRootRoutes()` and `defineApiRoutes()` with the built-in Hono routers.

- 7cdffbd: Add explicit `server/plugin.ts` definitions for Providers, API routes, root routes, database sources, and queue jobs. Register routes in a dedicated Application phase after Provider boot, add reusable HTTP and runtime composition helpers to their owning packages, and remove the default template's duplicate runtime layer and legacy plugin discovery contract.

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- c8f38c8: Register client plugins explicitly in the application's `client/plugins.ts` instead of discovering them from `nocobase.plugins` through a Vite virtual module.

  Each plugin now ships a `client/plugin.ts` descriptor, exported as `./client/plugin`, that declares its bootstrap, routes, providers, and route component overrides. An application composes them with `defineClientPlugins([...])`, where array order is bootstrap order and a plugin is enabled by being present. The entry is real, type-checked application source: it can be read, diffed, and edited, and Vite reloads it like any other module.

  Plugins can also accept options. `defineClientPlugin` takes an options type that reaches the bootstrap context, the routes and providers factories, and the route component overrides, so an application can pass a custom login page or a notification label at registration.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-registry-example` only drops its now-unread `nocobase.plugin.client` manifest field; it contributes no client extensions.

- 1a9732a: Re-export the client registration factory as the default from `client/index.ts`, so an application registers a plugin by importing `<package>/client` instead of `<package>/client/plugin`. `client/plugin.ts` still defines the factory and its `./client/plugin` subpath still resolves; the barrel simply re-exports it.

  Every plugin now declares `sideEffects: false`. An application imports the barrel, which also carries types, helpers, and components, and without that declaration a bundler must assume each of those matters and keeps them in the application entry chunk. With it, importing `<package>/client` costs exactly what importing `<package>/client/plugin` cost: the entry chunk is byte-identical for all eight plugins, where before it grew by 696 bytes for authentication and 88 for file.

  The declaration was checked rather than assumed: every client module's top-level statements are pure declarations, with no global assignment and no bare `import './x.css'`. The CSS imports under `app-plugin-workflow/registry` are copied as source by `registry materialize` and never bundled through `exports`. A plugin that later introduces a module-level side effect must drop the declaration.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-workflow` additionally points `./client` at `./client/index.ts` rather than `./dist/client/index.js`, matching every other plugin. Consuming the built output made the barrel resolve to a stale artifact, which failed the build outright.

### Patch Changes
