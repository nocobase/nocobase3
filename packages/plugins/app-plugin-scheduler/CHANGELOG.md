# @nocobase/app-plugin-scheduler

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- 9628cdd: Improve workflow and scheduler management pages with consistent layouts, filters, tables, and switches. Keep page layout and UI components local to their owning plugins, and align authorization pages with the same layout conventions.

  Normalize workflow and execution URLs under `/settings/workflow` and scheduler URLs under `/settings/schedules`, retaining the automation menu group without adding it to URLs. Update scheduler target links and the examples homepage entry. Use bookmarkable workflow/run child routes, preserve queries and browser history, and link execution detail titles to their workflow.

  Improve the workflow execution canvas with reorganized run controls, fullscreen viewing, terminal edge markers, direct empty-branch connections, and theme-aware styling. Unify node dialogs with consistent titles and close controls, collapsible descriptions, execution results and status colors, and explanatory states for unexecuted nodes.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- e0c4b3d: Add a transaction-safe physical row upsert API and use it through a unified Queue adapter accepting DatabaseConnection, with the upstream Knex client bridge kept private. Fix scheduler startup across database dialects while preserving schedule execution history.

  Preserve the outer Oracle transaction when a nested savepoint completes, allowing inserted rows to roll back with their owning transaction.

  Retry deadlocks with bounded backoff when a physical row upsert owns its transaction; preserve caller-owned transaction boundaries and propagate failures requiring the caller to retry.

  Recognize Dameng unique-key conflicts during concurrent upserts and preserve the outer transaction when knex-dm finishes a nested savepoint.

  Declare Knex as a Dameng runtime dependency so nested transaction support also works in registry installations.

### Minor Changes

- 26ac480: Add code-defined Cron scheduling with timezone support, transactional synchronization, and stable schedule identities. Applications and plugins register schedules with `SchedulerService.defineSchedule(definition)` and execution targets with `registerTarget()` during provider registration or boot.

  Route scheduled jobs and workers through the application's configured logical queue, with an adapter-neutral schedule store. Keep the upstream queue dependency unmodified and store queue and scheduler timestamps compatibly with their adapters while preserving absolute instants.

  Move queue storage migrations from Scheduler into the queue library, which resolves configured database connections and physical tables. Assemble these sources centrally in app-server for startup and CLI commands, rejecting overlapping active queue tables before execution. Support immutable target parameters, shared migration history and locks, upstream-compatible physical schemas, and read-only execution conditions that leave skipped migrations unapplied.

  Track idempotent occurrences through the target's final outcome, including asynchronous Workflow completion and recovery with stable run references. Target registration returns a completion-reporting handle scoped to that target; long-running executions can report completion without a fixed scheduler observation timeout.

  Provide an authorized, read-only schedule management page and API with paginated schedules, trigger counts, execution history, and separate schedule and execution statuses. Register `pnpm nocobase schedule sync` as a global CLI command and integrate it into all application templates.

  Include application examples for custom task targets and scheduled Workflows, and agent guidance for schedule definition, target selection, asynchronous execution, diagnostics, and recovery.

  Keep the database manifest CLI entry available before compilation so fresh workspace installs link the command required by package builds.

  Declare the OpenTelemetry dependencies referenced by the upstream queue declarations so consumers can typecheck published Server APIs without enabling tracing or skipping library checks.
