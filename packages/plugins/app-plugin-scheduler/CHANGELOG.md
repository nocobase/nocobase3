# @nocobase/app-plugin-scheduler

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- 26ac480: Add code-defined Cron scheduling with timezone support, transactional synchronization, and stable schedule identities. Applications and plugins register schedules with `SchedulerService.defineSchedule(definition)` and execution targets with `registerTarget()` during provider registration or boot.

  Route scheduled jobs and workers through the application's configured logical queue, with an adapter-neutral schedule store. Keep the upstream queue dependency unmodified and store queue and scheduler timestamps compatibly with their adapters while preserving absolute instants.

  Move queue storage migrations from Scheduler into the queue library, which resolves configured database connections and physical tables. Assemble these sources centrally in app-server for startup and CLI commands, rejecting overlapping active queue tables before execution. Support immutable target parameters, shared migration history and locks, upstream-compatible physical schemas, and read-only execution conditions that leave skipped migrations unapplied.

  Track idempotent occurrences through the target's final outcome, including asynchronous Workflow completion and recovery with stable run references. Target registration returns a completion-reporting handle scoped to that target; long-running executions can report completion without a fixed scheduler observation timeout.

  Provide an authorized, read-only schedule management page and API with paginated schedules, trigger counts, execution history, and separate schedule and execution statuses. Register `pnpm nocobase schedule sync` as a global CLI command and integrate it into all application templates.

  Include application examples for custom task targets and scheduled Workflows, and agent guidance for schedule definition, target selection, asynchronous execution, diagnostics, and recovery.

  Keep the database manifest CLI entry available before compilation so fresh workspace installs link the command required by package builds.

  Declare the OpenTelemetry dependencies referenced by the upstream queue declarations so consumers can typecheck published Server APIs without enabling tracing or skipping library checks.
