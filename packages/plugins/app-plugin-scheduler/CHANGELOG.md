### Patch Changes

- d696700: Stop the `bubblegum` theme from turning settings pages into competing hues, and fix the token misuse it exposed.

  The preset was carried over from tweakcn verbatim, and upstream spends the generic surface and outline roles on decoration: `--card` was a cream 101 degrees of hue away from the pink `--background`, `--border` was `--primary` itself at chroma 0.18 against a median of 0.02 across the other thirty presets, and `--muted` was a cyan. One demonstration card and a few dividers carry that; a settings page stacking several panels over dozens of hairlines does not, and pages showed pink, cream, cyan and teal at once. Six light values are retuned — `--card`, `--border`, `--muted`, `--input`, `--sidebar-border` and `--sidebar-primary` — keeping those roles in the background's hue family and leaving the preset's colour in `--primary`, `--secondary` and `--accent`. The dark values, the radius, and every other preset are unchanged, and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` records the deviation.

  The same pages also used tokens for something other than their role, which no neutral preset makes visible. Authorization's two page shells and four Hub pages painted the whole page with `bg-muted/20`, which is the page surface and belongs to `bg-background`; under a preset whose `--muted` is a real colour that was a film over the entire viewport. The AI employee page's read-only fields hand-rolled `bg-muted/40` instead of using the shared `Input` and `Textarea` with `disabled`, three information callouts were fixed `bg-blue-50`, and the MCP transport labels were fixed `bg-blue-100`/`bg-green-100`/`bg-amber-100`; the transports now take their three tones from the theme's chart series, which is what a preset defines to be told apart.

  Three fixed colours on settings pages are corrected while they are in hand. The AI employee page's missing-knowledge-base warning and the schedule detail page's target-issue icon named a light-mode ink with no dark counterpart, so both were close to unreadable on a dark card; they now carry one. The routes example reported a load failure in a fixed red, which is what `--destructive` is for.

  The theme authoring reference and the token reference now state the rule, so a preset converted tomorrow is checked against it.

- 095319c: Build the scheduled task list and detail pages from the same shared page sections, table, badge, and button components the other modules use, instead of page-local table markup and status chips.

### Patch Changes

- 4b3bcfe: Keep switch tracks and thumbs on the same theme spacing scale so compact themes preserve their proportions and checked alignment.

## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- 64b3fdb: Remove Refine from client authorization checks. Use `AuthorizationClient.can({ resource, action })` instead of the removed two-argument signature, and import `useCan` from `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/client`. Migrate page guards, navigation, and notification visibility while preserving session isolation and realtime permission invalidation.

  Remove the Refine access-control configuration and legacy global authorization client accessors. Resolve the application-owned client through `useAuthorizationClient()` or `authorizationClientToken`. Settings actions now revoke stale access immediately; route checks no longer bypass the authorization page or translate Refine CRUD action names.

  Unify route authorization under `authz: 'skip' | { resource: { type, id }, action }`. Normalize default rules during registration and share them across page guards, navigation, permission discovery, and inspection. Remove the legacy `access` field and string resource adapter.

  Limit settings action checks to the actions each page uses, keep the permission-set action helper internal, and avoid rebuilding navigation twice when selecting a route.

- 64b3fdb: Align workflow and scheduler route paths with their current pages while preserving page authorization, including nested workflow tabs. Remove duplicate development declarations for dependencies already required by the examples and hub server runtimes.
- 0f17c1b: Complete English and Chinese translations for workflow canvas controls and inspector statuses, and scheduled task target types, pending status, and execution reasons.
- 64b3fdb: Move workflow and schedule settings and detail routes to the read actions of system administration resources, grouped under Automation, instead of ordinary page permissions.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- 9628cdd: Improve workflow and scheduler management pages with consistent layouts, filters, tables, and switches. Keep page layout and UI components local to their owning plugins, and align authorization pages with the same layout conventions.

  Normalize workflow and execution URLs under `/settings/workflow` and scheduler URLs under `/settings/schedules`, retaining the automation menu group without adding it to URLs. Update scheduler target links and the examples homepage entry. Use bookmarkable workflow/run child routes, preserve queries and browser history, and link execution detail titles to their workflow.

  Improve the workflow execution canvas with reorganized run controls, fullscreen viewing, terminal edge markers, direct empty-branch connections, and theme-aware styling. Unify node dialogs with consistent titles and close controls, collapsible descriptions, execution results and status colors, and explanatory states for unexecuted nodes.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- e0c4b3d: Add a transaction-safe physical row upsert API and use it through a unified Queue adapter accepting DatabaseConnection, with the upstream Knex client bridge kept private. Fix scheduler startup across database dialects while preserving schedule execution history.

  Preserve the outer Oracle transaction when a nested savepoint completes, allowing inserted rows to roll back with their owning transaction.

  Retry deadlocks with bounded backoff when a physical row upsert owns its transaction; preserve caller-owned transaction boundaries and propagate failures requiring the caller to retry.

  Recognize Dameng unique-key conflicts during concurrent upserts and preserve the outer transaction when knex-dm finishes a nested savepoint.

  Declare Knex as a Dameng runtime dependency so nested transaction support also works in registry installations.

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- 26ac480: Add code-defined Cron scheduling with timezone support, transactional synchronization, and stable schedule identities. Applications and plugins register schedules with `SchedulerService.defineSchedule(definition)` and execution targets with `registerTarget()` during provider registration or boot.

  Route scheduled jobs and workers through the application's configured logical queue, with an adapter-neutral schedule store. Keep the upstream queue dependency unmodified and store queue and scheduler timestamps compatibly with their adapters while preserving absolute instants.

  Move queue storage migrations from Scheduler into the queue library, which resolves configured database connections and physical tables. Assemble these sources centrally in app-server for startup and CLI commands, rejecting overlapping active queue tables before execution. Support immutable target parameters, shared migration history and locks, upstream-compatible physical schemas, and read-only execution conditions that leave skipped migrations unapplied.

  Track idempotent occurrences through the target's final outcome, including asynchronous Workflow completion and recovery with stable run references. Target registration returns a completion-reporting handle scoped to that target; long-running executions can report completion without a fixed scheduler observation timeout.

  Provide an authorized, read-only schedule management page and API with paginated schedules, trigger counts, execution history, and separate schedule and execution statuses. Register `pnpm nocobase schedule sync` as a global CLI command and integrate it into all application templates.

  Include application examples for custom task targets and scheduled Workflows, and agent guidance for schedule definition, target selection, asynchronous execution, diagnostics, and recovery.

  Keep the database manifest CLI entry available before compilation so fresh workspace installs link the command required by package builds.

  Declare the OpenTelemetry dependencies referenced by the upstream queue declarations so consumers can typecheck published Server APIs without enabling tracing or skipping library checks.
