# @nocobase/app-plugin-api-keys

## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- 365a9fe: Complete English and Chinese translations for authentication, route feedback, authorization, shared controls, File and Notification Registry components, and development examples. Use concise semantic keys consistently for the new translations. Resolve AI Registry copy from the active language and localize development navigation and section headings. Translate MCP configuration guidance, tool drawer labels, and transport descriptions.
- 60fa139: Add confirmed user deletion for Hub platform administrators. Protect the current user, the last active platform administrator, and users who own applications. Revoke sessions and API Keys transactionally while retaining an inactive identity record for historical attribution. Prevent new applications and publishing keys from being created for deleted owners.
- 60fa139: Reuse the API Keys plugin through configuration-bound server operations and a scoped Authentication plugin API that preserves hooks and caller-owned transactions. Add per-application publishing API key management in Hub with one-time secret display, scoped Release and Deployment access, expiration, revocation, and current-owner permission checks.
- 60fa139: Add streamed, checksum-verified Hub release uploads, persistent upload and deployment retry identities, explicit upload-and-deploy requests, and App CLI upload/deploy commands. Reuse existing upload-release and deploy authorization actions and expose minimal deployment status for CI. Preserve historical releases during canonical checksum migration. Normalize permissions returned by the generic API key service.

  Support optional runtime configuration files for deploy and upload-with-deploy, with bounded streaming transport, existing configuration reuse, and configuration-aware retry checks.

  Reject upload-and-deploy requests that cannot return a publishing deployment, including CLI calls without waiting. Correct the unmerged publishing migration rollback.

- 60fa139: Declare the Better Auth API Key plugin's runtime peers explicitly so deployments with automatic peer installation disabled can load the plugin even when Better Auth's own dependencies are nested.

### Patch Changes

- 6acf3bc: Use plugin-owned PageContainer components to unify settings page width, spacing, and responsive padding across database exploration, user management, API keys, workflows, and notification logs.

  Use plugin-owned PageHeader components for consistent titles, descriptions, and page actions while preserving permission checks and workflow detail navigation.

  Preserve spacing below workflow tabs and wrap workflow list filters and actions on narrow screens.

  Restore spacing between workflow detail back links and headings, and keep execution duration cells aligned when table rows grow.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- a60decd: Require an explicit absolute baseDir for Server plugins and resolve migrations, seeds, jobs, and package metadata from the loaded plugin copy. Generate and validate database task manifests during builds so TypeScript and JavaScript share source checksums, with verified legacy JavaScript history conversion and synchronized plugin scaffolding and application templates.

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- 154e09e: Add `@nocobase/app-plugin-api-keys`, which lets scripts and integrations call an application's API as the user who issued the key.

  The package is Better Auth's API Key plugin plus the parts an application needs around it: the `apikey` table migration, a self-service Settings page where each user creates and revokes their own keys, and `apiKey` and `apiKeyClient` carrying Better Auth's own names and options. `apiKey` is wrapped only to supply three defaults, all of them overridable; its documentation applies unchanged.

  The re-export is what keeps the migration honest. That table has to match the schema the installed `@better-auth/api-key` declares, so both come from one package rather than from a dependency each application pins separately; a test asserts the table carries a column for every field the plugin declares.

  Configured in `auth.plugins`, `Auth.getSession()` resolves an `x-api-key` header the same way it resolves a session cookie, so `auth.required()`, the route guards, and Authorization all see the owning user and exactly the roles that user holds. No application route needs to know a request arrived by key.

  The three defaults are `enableSessionForAPIKeys: true`, `rateLimit: { enabled: false }` and `requireName: true`. The first is the one that has to be set: Better Auth defaults it off, and with it off a key authenticates nothing — the page still issues keys and every request carrying one answers 401, with nothing pointing at the configuration. The second avoids the upstream default of 10 requests per key per day, which is a quota for issuing keys rather than for using them. Supplying them here rather than in each application's auth config is what keeps a required setting from being something an application can silently get wrong.

  A key is its owner, so it also reaches the Better Auth endpoints a session reaches — including `/api-key/create`, which means a key can mint a successor with its own expiry that revoking the first key does not revoke. Revoking a leaked key means reviewing the owner's whole list. An application that wants that closed adds its own `before` hook.
