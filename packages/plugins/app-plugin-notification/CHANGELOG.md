# @nocobase/app-plugin-notification

## Unreleased

### Minor Changes

- Move notification testing into the core plugin with safe dynamic target
  descriptors, separate `notification:test` `send` authorization, actor-scoped
  status lookup, and delivery through the normal manager send path. Validate
  enabled Channel and Provider configuration after extension registration and
  fail fast when required runtime dependencies are missing. Separate the
  public sending service from the Channel/Provider extension registry so child
  plugins do not depend on the complete manager surface.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- 174eab5: Consolidate the browser packages into `@nocobase/app-client`.

  `@nocobase/app-sdk` is gone; its API client now lives in `@nocobase/app-client` and is imported from there. `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk` is deprecated and keeps only what still has consumers: `NocoBaseClient` and the runtime configuration it reads, which exist to reach a v2 NocoBase server, and the route surface containers under `/routing`. Its ACL, auth, data, extension, i18n, and system-settings modules are removed, as is the route tree that `/routing` used to export alongside the surfaces.

  `@nocobase/app-client` gains `resolveAppBase()`, which reports the path the application is mounted at.

  Four plugins built their API client at import time instead of resolving it from the application's service container, so they could not see `api.baseURL` from the application configuration. They now resolve it, which means an application that configures a base URL gets one client rather than two that disagree.

  The injected browser global `NOCOBASE_PORTAL_BASE` is renamed to `APP_BASE_PATH`. Its value has always been the `APP_BASE_PATH` environment variable, and the old name grouped it with the settings that address a v2 NocoBase server. Those keep their names. A client and the server that serves it must be upgraded together.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-data-provider` is removed. It forwarded the Portal data provider, and applications built on the current client runtime do not use it.

  The Hub template is rebuilt from the default template and now runs the same client and server stack as every other v3 application. Its `/api/apps` endpoint and its v2 API proxy are gone, so a hub's `.env` no longer configures them.

  The Portal SDK's template compatibility check is removed with the rest: it had been disabled behind a constant, and its install script cost every generated project a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds` entry it did not need. `createPortalViteConfig` no longer takes the plugin that injected it.

- 1527426: Declare identity-sensitive runtime packages as peer dependencies of every plugin.

  A plugin used to list `@nocobase/app-server`, `@nocobase/db`, `@nocobase/service-provider`, `@nocobase/i18n`, `@nocobase/queue`, `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk`, and the plugins it builds on among its `dependencies`. Each of these carries state that only works while exactly one copy of the module exists in the process: `ServiceContainer` keys its bindings by the token object itself, React contexts match only the provider created from the same module, and `@nocobase/queue` registers job classes into a global `Locator`. A `dependencies` range lets a package manager install a second copy to satisfy it, which splits that state.

  The monorepo could never show the problem, because `workspace:` links every consumer to one directory. It appears once a plugin is installed from a registry into an application, and it appears at runtime rather than at install time: a service that is registered reports `Service "..." is not registered`, or a context reads `undefined` under a mounted provider.

  Each of these packages is now a peer dependency paired with a devDependency. The peer is the published contract that makes the installing application provide the single copy; the devDependency pins this repository's copy for development and tests, which the deliberately wide peer range does not. Applications built from the templates are unaffected — they already install every one of these packages directly, which is what satisfies the new peer ranges.

  `pnpm plugin:create` generates the same shape, and `pnpm peers:check` enforces it in CI.

### Patch Changes

- c64802c: Publish an application-facing Agent Skill for integrating, configuring, sending, inspecting, extending, and diagnosing NocoBase notifications.
- 174eab5: Correct the `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk` range these Registry recipes declare. It named `^2.0.0`, a version the v3 package never had, so installing one of these recipes into an application could not resolve the dependency it needs for its v2 API calls.
- c64802c: Harden notification packaging, Provider error redaction, in-app pagination and input validation, migration coverage, Agent Skill safety, localization, and production demo-route defaults.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- ac3f033: Replace aggregated application configuration objects and config factories with typed module-owned configuration definitions. Applications now compose defaults, file providers, environment layers, validation, explicit reloads, and subscriptions through `AppConfig`, while providers read their configuration through `app.config.get(definition)`.
- ac3f033: Export every server plugin from its package's `./server` entry point, and update application composition, plugin discovery, and generated plugins to use the unified entry point.

### Patch Changes

- 78cf0a2: Generate runtime-aware TypeScript, ESLint, Node engine, and development dependency configuration for Client-only, Server-only, and full-stack plugins, including stable package-scoped Queue Job identities.

  Keep plugins aligned with the Agent development contract by giving Queue, System Information, and Workflow Routes path-scoped authentication, documenting the Queue API path and Database declaration source accurately, and storing example tests under each plugin's root test directory.

- fb1a752: Unify Client and Server application composition around the explicit `serviceProviders` contribution and rename Client React tree contributions to `reactProviders`.

  Replace Client bootstrap modules with application-owned ServiceProvider lifecycle hooks, make the default Client start through `ClientApplication` and render through the Browser host, and update built-in plugins and runtime inspection to the new static contribution protocol.

## 0.0.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- 7cdffbd: Replace separate API and root route arrays with one ordered `routes` contribution array. Route factories now receive the Application, create and return their own Hono router, and are mounted automatically at `/api` or the application root according to their definition.

  Standardize plugin server modules around `providers/index.ts` and `routes/index.ts` collection entries, `services/` domain implementations, and a stable `tokens.ts` public contract.

  Generated plugins now declare conventional database and queue contribution directories by default. Missing optional directories are ignored until executable migrations, seeds, or jobs are added.

  Generated plugins now include an App-facing starter Agent Skill under the package's `skills/` directory. Plugin registration and skill synchronization copy these package-owned Skills into registered applications' `.agents/skills/` directories.

  Unify Client page contributions behind one `routes` loader. Plugins now use `defineAppRoutes()` and `defineSettingsRoutes()` to add child Routes to the application's two built-in Client Routes, mirroring how Server plugins use `defineRootRoutes()` and `defineApiRoutes()` with the built-in Hono routers.

- 7cdffbd: Add explicit `server/plugin.ts` definitions for Providers, API routes, root routes, database sources, and queue jobs. Register routes in a dedicated Application phase after Provider boot, add reusable HTTP and runtime composition helpers to their owning packages, and remove the default template's duplicate runtime layer and legacy plugin discovery contract.
- 8438765: Add Resend, Feishu, and DingTalk notification Providers; allow Feishu and DingTalk to be enabled together with logical IM targets and channel-scoped `single` or `all` Provider routing; add provider-aware recipient resolution and structured delivery errors; add an access-controlled Notification logs page to Hub settings; and document secure template configuration and authenticated Provider verification.
