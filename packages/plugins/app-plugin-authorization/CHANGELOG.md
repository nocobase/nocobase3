# @nocobase/app-plugin-authorization

## 0.2.0-beta.5

### Minor Changes

- 6f9b399: Rewrite the template's agent and human documentation around building an application rather than developing a plugin. `README.md` now describes the project structure, how to run it, and what each of its own pnpm scripts does; `AGENTS.md` describes how to build a feature — pages, shadcn/ui components, endpoints, database access, migrations, and translations — and routes to a new `skills/nocobase-app-development/` skill whose references carry the detail. The nested `client/AGENTS.md` and `server/AGENTS.md` are rewritten to match: the server guide previously told agents to put new domain APIs in a plugin package, the opposite of what an application scaffold should say, and the client guide was largely about a `client-old/` directory that no longer exists.

  The page-to-sidebar path is now written down. Declaring a route makes the URL work but leaves the page out of navigation, which needs a Refine resource registered in `client/service-provider.ts`; the documentation previously described only the route half, so a page added by following it would have been unreachable from the sidebar. The guidance also now separates the directories business code belongs in from the framework scaffolding the template replaces on upgrade, and asks that both be updated together when an application changes that structure.

  The authorization Skill moves from `@nocobase/authorization` to `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization` and is renamed `nocobase-app-plugin-authorization`. Skills synchronize from registered plugins, so one published by a library could never reach an application; its example also imported `@nocobase/authorization/database`, which an application does not depend on, and now imports the types the plugin re-exports.

  The guidance now points at the plugins an application already has. A prompt asking for approvals, notifications, or per-user record access was answerable only by building those from scratch, because nothing told an agent that `app-plugin-workflow`, `app-plugin-notification`, and `app-plugin-authorization` are installed and publish their own Skills — `.agents/skills/` was described only as generated output not to edit. Server route guidance also covered `can()` but not `authorize()`, so an ownership rule like "a salesperson sees only their own customers" had no documented path other than filtering rows in memory after fetching them, and scheduled work had no guidance at all.

  Application-owned migrations now reach the build. `database/migrations` and `database/seeds` exist in the template, and `tsconfig.server.json` compiles `database/**/*.ts`, so a migration an application writes is typechecked and emitted to `dist/database/` — which `scripts/build-server-dist-package.mjs` already expected to find. `pnpm migrate` applied such a migration before this change, but `pnpm build` silently dropped it. The unreferenced `tsconfig.migrations.base.json` is removed.

  `app-template-hub` receives the same framework-level change, since it is the same application scaffold with a different product identity: the rewritten documentation and the `nocobase-app-development` Skill, `CLAUDE.md`, and the migration build fix, which it had the identical version of. The repository `AGENTS.md` now records that framework changes to one template belong in the other by default, with the parts that stay template-specific.

## 0.2.0-beta.4

### Minor Changes

- 174eab5: Consolidate the browser packages into `@nocobase/app-client`.

  `@nocobase/app-sdk` is gone; its API client now lives in `@nocobase/app-client` and is imported from there. `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk` is deprecated and keeps only what still has consumers: `NocoBaseClient` and the runtime configuration it reads, which exist to reach a v2 NocoBase server, and the route surface containers under `/routing`. Its ACL, auth, data, extension, i18n, and system-settings modules are removed, as is the route tree that `/routing` used to export alongside the surfaces.

  `@nocobase/app-client` gains `resolveAppBase()`, which reports the path the application is mounted at.

  Four plugins built their API client at import time instead of resolving it from the application's service container, so they could not see `api.baseURL` from the application configuration. They now resolve it, which means an application that configures a base URL gets one client rather than two that disagree.

  The injected browser global `NOCOBASE_PORTAL_BASE` is renamed to `APP_BASE_PATH`. Its value has always been the `APP_BASE_PATH` environment variable, and the old name grouped it with the settings that address a v2 NocoBase server. Those keep their names. A client and the server that serves it must be upgraded together.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-data-provider` is removed. It forwarded the Portal data provider, and applications built on the current client runtime do not use it.

  The Hub template is rebuilt from the default template and now runs the same client and server stack as every other v3 application. Its `/api/apps` endpoint and its v2 API proxy are gone, so a hub's `.env` no longer configures them.

  The Portal SDK's template compatibility check is removed with the rest: it had been disabled behind a constant, and its install script cost every generated project a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds` entry it did not need. `createPortalViteConfig` no longer takes the plugin that injected it.

- 1527426: Declare identity-sensitive runtime packages as peer dependencies of every plugin.

  A plugin used to list `@nocobase/app-server`, `@nocobase/db`, `@nocobase/service-provider`, `@nocobase/i18n`, `@nocobase/queue`, `@nocobase/app-portal-sdk`, and the plugins it builds on among its `dependencies`. Each of these carries state that only works while exactly one copy of the module exists in the process: `ServiceContainer` keys its bindings by the token object itself, React contexts match only the provider created from the same module, and `@nocobase/queue` registers job classes into a global `Locator`. A `dependencies` range lets a package manager install a second copy to satisfy it, which splits that state.

  The monorepo could never show the problem, because `workspace:` links every consumer to one directory. It appears once a plugin is installed from a registry into an application, and it appears at runtime rather than at install time: a service that is registered reports `Service "..." is not registered`, or a context reads `undefined` under a mounted provider.

  Each of these packages is now a peer dependency paired with a devDependency. The peer is the published contract that makes the installing application provide the single copy; the devDependency pins this repository's copy for development and tests, which the deliberately wide peer range does not. Applications built from the templates are unaffected — they already install every one of these packages directly, which is what satisfies the new peer ranges.

  `pnpm plugin:create` generates the same shape, and `pnpm peers:check` enforces it in CI.

## 0.2.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- ac3f033: Export every server plugin from its package's `./server` entry point, and update application composition, plugin discovery, and generated plugins to use the unified entry point.

### Patch Changes

- fb1a752: Unify Client and Server application composition around the explicit `serviceProviders` contribution and rename Client React tree contributions to `reactProviders`.

  Replace Client bootstrap modules with application-owned ServiceProvider lifecycle hooks, make the default Client start through `ClientApplication` and render through the Browser host, and update built-in plugins and runtime inspection to the new static contribution protocol.

## 0.2.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- ce4eab8: Add a focused ServiceProvider plugin example with a tokenized heartbeat
  service, lifecycle management, and an HTTP status route. Pass the Application
  directly to providers and standardize service access through `app.container`.
- 7cdffbd: Replace separate API and root route arrays with one ordered `routes` contribution array. Route factories now receive the Application, create and return their own Hono router, and are mounted automatically at `/api` or the application root according to their definition.

  Standardize plugin server modules around `providers/index.ts` and `routes/index.ts` collection entries, `services/` domain implementations, and a stable `tokens.ts` public contract.

  Generated plugins now declare conventional database and queue contribution directories by default. Missing optional directories are ignored until executable migrations, seeds, or jobs are added.

  Generated plugins now include an App-facing starter Agent Skill under the package's `skills/` directory. Plugin registration and skill synchronization copy these package-owned Skills into registered applications' `.agents/skills/` directories.

  Unify Client page contributions behind one `routes` loader. Plugins now use `defineAppRoutes()` and `defineSettingsRoutes()` to add child Routes to the application's two built-in Client Routes, mirroring how Server plugins use `defineRootRoutes()` and `defineApiRoutes()` with the built-in Hono routers.

- 7cdffbd: Add explicit `server/plugin.ts` definitions for Providers, API routes, root routes, database sources, and queue jobs. Register routes in a dedicated Application phase after Provider boot, add reusable HTTP and runtime composition helpers to their owning packages, and remove the default template's duplicate runtime layer and legacy plugin discovery contract.

## 0.2.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- 062f5b1: Add `settings` to `defineClientPlugin`, a fourth contribution type alongside `bootstrap`, `routes`, and `providers`. A plugin points it at a module that default-exports an array of setting definitions, or a function of the plugin options returning one, and each entry becomes a page in the application's settings centre.

  An entry is either a page — `id`, `title`, an optional `icon` and `access` rule, and a `pageLoader` — or a group that carries an icon and title once for a set of pages. Ids are single URL segments and nesting comes from the tree, so a page under a group is served at `/settings/<group>/<page>`, and a plugin contributing one page declares it without a group and gets `/settings/<id>`. Groups nest one level. Settings and routes share one path space, so a route and a page that would mount at the same address fail resolution with both identities named.

  The default template renders the settings centre, reusing the application shell's chrome — brand, sidebar collapse, theme, and user menu — with `Back to app` where the workspace label sits and no gear pointing at itself. The left rail collapses by group the way the product sidebar does. A page whose `access` rule is denied is left out of the navigation and cannot be reached by its URL either, and a group whose pages are all denied disappears with them. A setting whose `access` rule is denied is left out of the navigation and cannot be reached by its URL either. Authorization's four administration pages now arrive this way, at the URLs they already had, and no longer appear in the product sidebar.

  `client:inspect` gains `--type settings`, and `pnpm plugin:create` scaffolds a `client/settings.ts` entry.

- c8f38c8: Register client plugins explicitly in the application's `client/plugins.ts` instead of discovering them from `nocobase.plugins` through a Vite virtual module.

  Each plugin now ships a `client/plugin.ts` descriptor, exported as `./client/plugin`, that declares its bootstrap, routes, providers, and route component overrides. An application composes them with `defineClientPlugins([...])`, where array order is bootstrap order and a plugin is enabled by being present. The entry is real, type-checked application source: it can be read, diffed, and edited, and Vite reloads it like any other module.

  Plugins can also accept options. `defineClientPlugin` takes an options type that reaches the bootstrap context, the routes and providers factories, and the route component overrides, so an application can pass a custom login page or a notification label at registration.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-registry-example` only drops its now-unread `nocobase.plugin.client` manifest field; it contributes no client extensions.

- 1a9732a: Re-export the client registration factory as the default from `client/index.ts`, so an application registers a plugin by importing `<package>/client` instead of `<package>/client/plugin`. `client/plugin.ts` still defines the factory and its `./client/plugin` subpath still resolves; the barrel simply re-exports it.

  Every plugin now declares `sideEffects: false`. An application imports the barrel, which also carries types, helpers, and components, and without that declaration a bundler must assume each of those matters and keeps them in the application entry chunk. With it, importing `<package>/client` costs exactly what importing `<package>/client/plugin` cost: the entry chunk is byte-identical for all eight plugins, where before it grew by 696 bytes for authentication and 88 for file.

  The declaration was checked rather than assumed: every client module's top-level statements are pure declarations, with no global assignment and no bare `import './x.css'`. The CSS imports under `app-plugin-workflow/registry` are copied as source by `registry materialize` and never bundled through `exports`. A plugin that later introduces a module-level side effect must drop the declaration.

  `@nocobase/app-plugin-workflow` additionally points `./client` at `./client/index.ts` rather than `./dist/client/index.js`, matching every other plugin. Consuming the built output made the barrel resolve to a stale artifact, which failed the build outright.

## 0.1.1-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- 0465323: Introduce the plugin-based authorization core and permission management UI. Replace the previous authorization API with composable core, database, permission-set, default-access, sharing-rule, restriction-rule, and page plugins; add route access metadata to the application client; publish and enable the authorization app plugin in the default template; and correct the Hub documentation to use the v3 Portal SDK package name.
- b269e38: Publish this package. It was marked private, so it never reached the registry even though the default template depends on it and enables it, which left `pnpm install` in a generated application failing with a 404.
