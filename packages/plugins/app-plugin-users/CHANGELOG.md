### Patch Changes

- d696700: Give every settings surface the token that matches what it is, so panels stop disagreeing with one another.

  The permission set editor is where this shows: its two tabs sit in one panel, and the permission configuration tab painted itself `bg-background` while the assignment tab inherited the panel's `bg-card`, so switching tabs changed the page colour under the same heading. The same mistake is spread across the settings pages, and none of it is visible under a preset whose page and card are near-identical.

  Each token names a layer rather than a shade, and every site now uses the one that describes it. A panel resting on the page is `bg-card`, which is what the AI tools and skills pages already used while the LLM service, MCP service, conversation, API key, user and notification log panels named the page surface instead — two lists in one plugin, one framed and one flat. A dialog or drawer is `bg-popover`, which is what the shared `Sheet`, `Dialog` and `Popover` primitives use and what six hand-rolled drawers and dialogs did not. An opaque sticky header, footer or table head names the surface it scrolls within rather than the page behind it. A form control names no surface at all and inherits the one it sits on, the way the shared `Input` and `Textarea` do with `bg-transparent`; twenty hand-rolled inputs, selects and text areas were pinned to the page colour and showed through as a differently coloured box inside every card.

  The styling reference now states which token describes which layer, and why picking one because it happens to look right is what puts a page-coloured block inside a panel.

### Minor Changes

- 64b3fdb: Support registered authorization subject selectors with permission-checked search, pagination, and name resolution. Share the dynamic picker across permission-set assignments, sharing rules, and restriction rules, and integrate the existing user service.

### Patch Changes

- 64b3fdb: Separate authorization services from application integration: the library provides decisions, permission-set and access-rule services, store contracts and handlers; the application plugin owns database adapters, migrations, identities and management UI.

  Add configurable root and default permission sets, protected-set metadata, transaction-bound service APIs, and integration with user management and Hub roles. Add database authorization for explicitly registered collections through Repository policies, plus a runnable example plugin.

  Provide a permission-set workspace with routed editing and user assignments, nested resource groups, field and record-scope controls, and a permission inspector. Localize management UI and request-specific resource labels. Application routes may declare signed-in access without a page grant.

  Migration ownership changes inline the existing table definitions in the application plugin. This changes the checksums of previously executed migrations; upgrade compatibility must be resolved before deploying to an existing database.

- 64b3fdb: Separate business resource declarations from underlying handler registration through `resourceTypes`. Remove transitional registration aliases and legacy title decoding. Store rule record IDs directly in each action's JSON, preserving independent named scopes without auxiliary record tables. Initialize the sales example and Hub permission titles directly in their final form, without development-version upgrade scripts.
- 64b3fdb: Integrate source-qualified database authorization and native relation policies with AI data services. Preserve explicit route group extensions, translated resource search, Hub ownership checks, API key cleanup, and protected permission-set assignments across user deletion. Update shared application guidance for the split authorization plugins.
- 64b3fdb: Separate permission-set assignment management from CRUD, use one configure permission for default access, and register an independent permission inspector with its own options and subject selection endpoints. Reflect the operations in management controls and the user inspection shortcut.
- 64b3fdb: Add composed business operations with named data scopes and categorized business and administration groups. Permission and rule editors expose only this catalog; page, collection and custom resource handlers remain internal authorization targets.

  Enforce per-operation default access, sharing and restriction scopes while preserving field permissions. Return resolved underlying decisions and repository policies for inspection and execution.

  Use translation descriptors for permission titles, integrate permission-set assignments into user management, and demonstrate independent project, quote and order scopes with direct and team-based assignments.

- 64b3fdb: Remove Refine from client authorization checks. Use `AuthorizationClient.can({ resource, action })` instead of the removed two-argument signature, and import `useCan` from `@nocobase/app-plugin-authorization/client`. Migrate page guards, navigation, and notification visibility while preserving session isolation and realtime permission invalidation.

  Remove the Refine access-control configuration and legacy global authorization client accessors. Resolve the application-owned client through `useAuthorizationClient()` or `authorizationClientToken`. Settings actions now revoke stale access immediately; route checks no longer bypass the authorization page or translate Refine CRUD action names.

  Unify route authorization under `authz: 'skip' | { resource: { type, id }, action }`. Normalize default rules during registration and share them across page guards, navigation, permission discovery, and inspection. Remove the legacy `access` field and string resource adapter.

  Limit settings action checks to the actions each page uses, keep the permission-set action helper internal, and avoid rebuilding navigation twice when selecting a route.

- 64b3fdb: Move default user permission-set integration into the Users plugin and remove duplicated template providers. Add application-owned preset title metadata for client-side localization without overwriting custom names. Preserve Hub's custom role scope and share searchable assignment selection between user creation and editing.
- 64b3fdb: Replace inline user permission editing with a searchable drawer that previews changes and saves them together. Clarify permission-set terminology and show compact direct-assignment summaries.

### Patch Changes

- 365a9fe: Complete English and Chinese translations for authentication, route feedback, authorization, shared controls, File and Notification Registry components, and development examples. Use concise semantic keys consistently for the new translations. Resolve AI Registry copy from the active language and localize development navigation and section headings. Translate MCP configuration guidance, tool drawer labels, and transport descriptions.
- 60fa139: Add confirmed user deletion for Hub platform administrators. Protect the current user, the last active platform administrator, and users who own applications. Revoke sessions and API Keys transactionally while retaining an inactive identity record for historical attribution. Prevent new applications and publishing keys from being created for deleted owners.
- d4ca00e: Use useApiClient() for React API client access across application pages, plugins and shared examples, preserving application-scoped client resolution.

### Patch Changes

- 028dd7c: Use host-provided peers for shared database types, authorization errors, service tokens, cache registries, and repository filter metadata. Declare their production providers in all application templates so deployments with automatic peer installation disabled retain the required runtime packages. Document the provider contract for generated plugins.

  Existing applications upgrading these packages must add compatible versions of their required shared peers to production dependencies: @nocobase/db, @nocobase/service-provider, @nocobase/repository-input, @nocobase/authorization, @nocobase/caching, @nocobase/i18n, and @nocobase/queue for the standard server stack, plus @nocobase/ai-employee when using its plugin. Update the lockfile and verify the production install; peer declarations do not remove incompatible historical versions automatically.

### Patch Changes

- 6acf3bc: Use plugin-owned PageContainer components to unify settings page width, spacing, and responsive padding across database exploration, user management, API keys, workflows, and notification logs.

  Use plugin-owned PageHeader components for consistent titles, descriptions, and page actions while preserving permission checks and workflow detail navigation.

  Preserve spacing below workflow tabs and wrap workflow list filters and actions on narrow screens.

  Restore spacing between workflow detail back links and headings, and keep execution duration cells aligned when table rows grow.

### Patch Changes

- e3fa827: Add reusable user administration and Hub-scoped role-based authorization. Authentication now supports disabled accounts, transaction-aware administration, stable duplicate-identity conflicts, Session revocation, and immediate Realtime disconnects. Authorization supports protected Permission Sets, atomic scoped assignment replacement, and Client permission invalidation. The Users page supports protected role options, readable multi-role editing, explicit unassigned states, and a distinction between direct roles and authenticated-user defaults; password reset and database Session revocation share one transaction. The default App exposes its direct Authorization Permission Sets as application roles while keeping System administrator changes in Authorization. The Hub defines Administrator, Operator, and Viewer roles, batch-loads their user assignments, enforces every Hub and user-management action on the server, protects the final enabled Administrator, and hides unauthorized Client controls. Both templates register the reusable Users plugin; Hub exposes Applications, User management, and a read-only role matrix directly in its control-plane navigation, while the default App keeps Users in Settings. Only the Hub template receives Hub roles, disables public sign-up, and omits ordinary App Settings, workflows, notifications, and example plugins.
