/**
 * Directories that lint themselves rather than being covered by the root ESLint configuration, given as
 * repository-relative prefixes. A directory belongs here when it has its own `eslint.config.*` AND its own ESLint
 * dependency, because both halves matter: the root configuration enumerates the package roots it applies to and
 * matches nothing under such a directory, so linting its files from the root silently succeeds without running a
 * single rule, and `docs` is on ESLint 9 while the root is on ESLint 10, so the binary has to come from there too.
 *
 * Everything under `packages/` is covered by the root configuration and must not be listed.

/**
 * ESLint runs once per package rather than once for every staged file.
 *
 * The type-aware rules build a TypeScript program per file and hold it for the length of the run, so a single process
 * grows with the size of the commit. A repository-wide change — a refactor that moves every package, a dependency bump
 * that rewrites every manifest — exhausts the heap, and the hook dies with an allocation failure rather than a lint
 * result. Splitting by package bounds it: each process exits and frees what it held before the next starts.
 *
 * Grouping costs nothing for an ordinary commit, which touches one or two packages and so produces one or two
 * commands, the same as before.
 *
 * Prettier still takes every staged file in one command. It formats a file at a time with no cross-file analysis, so
 * its memory does not scale with the size of the commit the way ESLint's does. It also needs no per-directory
 * treatment: `docs` inherits the same shared Prettier configuration as everything else, and the root
 * `.prettierignore` — which the command below passes explicitly — is what decides which of its files are skipped.
