# Create with an AI Agent

Ask your AI Agent to check the environment, create a project, and start it locally.

## Create the application

1. **Start an AI Agent session**

   Start a new session with an empty application directory as its working directory:

   - **CLI:** create an empty directory, enter it in your terminal, then launch your AI Agent and start a new session
   - **Desktop client:** create an empty directory, add it as a project or workspace, then create a new session within it

   :::tip Directory naming requirements

   **The directory name becomes the application's default name.** It must start with a lowercase English letter or digit and contain only lowercase English letters, digits, dots (`.`), hyphens (`-`), or underscores (`_`). Chinese characters, spaces, and uppercase letters are not allowed. Suggested names include `my-app`, `crm-demo`, and `order-system`.

   :::

2. **Create the application**

   Copy and send this prompt in the session you just started:

   ```text
   Follow https://v3.docs.nocobase.com/get-started/create-app-with-agent to create a NocoBase 3 application for me.
   ```

   Your AI Agent will check the environment, initialize the application in the current empty directory, read its project guidance, confirm your database requirements, and start the service. You can continue in the same session.

   :::tip If you create the application in another directory

   After creation, switch to that project and start a new session:

   - **CLI:** enter the project directory and restart your AI Agent
   - **Desktop client:** add or open that project and create a new session

   :::

   After startup, open the URL provided by your AI Agent.

## Sign in

The browser opens the sign-in page:

![Sign-in page of a new application](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/nb3-docs-20260916-login-en.png)

Your AI Agent should provide the URL and sign-in instructions after startup. When using the template’s initial administrator, the credentials are:

| Field    | Initial value        |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Email    | `admin@nocobase.com` |
| Password | `admin123`           |

Use this account for the first local walkthrough. Change the initial password and configure production access before exposing the application. If you configured your own administrator during installation or connected an existing database, use those credentials.

After signing in, you see the application home page. Use “Language” in the account menu at the top right to switch languages.

The order menu shown here is added on the next page. A newly created application does not have it yet.

## Stop and restart

Ask your AI Agent to stop the development service. Next time, start a session in the same application directory and ask it to start the existing application. If you manage the terminal yourself, press `Ctrl+C` to stop and run `pnpm dev` from the application directory to restart. Do not recreate the project.

Use `pnpm dev` during development. `pnpm build` followed by `pnpm start` runs a built application; keep development mode for this walkthrough.

## Next step

Continue in the session rooted in your application directory and [build your first feature](./first-feature). The AI Agent's installation, account, and model access must be prepared separately.

Next, hand the project to your AI Agent and let it start building. To build a CRM application, for example, tell it:

```text
Build a CRM application based on this NocoBase 3 project template.
```

Describe the business goal, the roles involved, and any existing tables or processes; the AI Agent turns that into pages, data models, and flows.
