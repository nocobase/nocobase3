'@nocobase/create-app': patch
---

Keep the template's identity out of generated applications. The manifest no longer has its `version` reset or `private` added, so an app records which template release it came from; `displayName` and `description` are now dropped, which previously left a new app labelled "Default Template". Comment blocks in `.env.local` whose settings were replaced are removed along with them, instead of leaving headings with nothing under them.
