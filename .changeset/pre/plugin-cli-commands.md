Let plugins contribute commands to an application's CLI, and rename the bin to `nocobase`.

An application now has a `cli/` composition root beside `client/` and `server/`. Its `cli/index.ts` calls `runAppCli()` from `@nocobase/nb3-cli/runtime`, which assembles one command tree from three sources: the built-in plugin management commands under `plugin`, the application's own commands under `app`, and each registered plugin's commands under the topic that plugin declares. `pnpm nocobase` runs it.

A plugin contributes commands by exporting a `./cli` entry that calls `defineCliPlugin()` with a topic and a map of oclif `Command` subclasses. `@nocobase/app-plugin-cli-example` is the reference implementation. `@oclif/core` is a peer dependency of such a plugin so that the plugin and the application share one copy, which is what keeps help rendering and flag parsing consistent.

`plugin register`, `plugin unregister`, and `plugin inspect` maintain `cli/plugins.ts` the same way they already maintain `client/plugins.ts` and `server/plugins.ts`, keyed on whether the plugin exports `./cli`. An application without TypeScript degrades to printed instructions for that file exactly as it does for the other two.

Two breaking changes come with this. The bin is `nocobase` rather than `nb3`, and the five plugin commands moved from `app plugin *` to the top-level `plugin *`, which frees the `app` topic for the commands an application writes itself. The `pnpm plugin:*` script names are unchanged, so anything invoking those scripts is unaffected.
