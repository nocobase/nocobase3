'@nocobase/app-template-default': patch

Add `nb3 app plugin register` and `nb3 app plugin unregister`, so an application generated from the template can install, wire, and remove a plugin. Both are available as `pnpm plugin:register` and `pnpm plugin:unregister`.

Registering installs the package, records the dependency and the `nocobase.plugins` entry, imports the plugin in `client/plugins.ts`, and copies the skills it ships into `.agents/skills`. Unregistering reverses all four. The editing logic is shared with this repository's own `plugin:register` scripts; only the plugin lookup and the recorded dependency range differ.

Only a plugin that ships a `./client/plugin` export is written into `client/plugins.ts`. A server-only plugin is registered without it, because importing an export it does not have leaves the application unable to build.

An application without TypeScript still gets the install, the manifest entry, and the skills; only the `client/plugins.ts` edit is skipped, and the exact lines to add are printed so they can be applied by hand or by an agent.
