Improve Hub App management with server-side catalog search and pagination, URL-addressable App detail Tabs, unified runtime status and action availability feedback, and application removal from the catalog.

The catalog search is scoped to the Collection's database schema, so it works on PostgreSQL when the application runs outside the connection's default schema, and Hub reads no longer wait indefinitely for startup restoration; Apps the Host has not reached yet are reported as pending in the meantime.

`GET /hub/apps` now returns a pagination object rather than an array. The response body changes from `HubAppSummary[]` to `{ items, total, page, pageSize }`, and accepts `search`, `page`, and `pageSize` query parameters. Any HTTP client reading the array directly has to read `items` instead. The `HubService.listApps()` method keeps its existing array return type; the new `HubService.listAppsPage()` serves the paginated route.
